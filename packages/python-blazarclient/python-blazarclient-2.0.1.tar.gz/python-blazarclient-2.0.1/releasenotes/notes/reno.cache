    upgrade: ['When creating a lease using the CLI client, the default value for start

        date was changed to use the string ''now'', which is resolved to the current

        time on the server rather than on the client. Note that if the request is

        sent at the end of a minute and interpreted by the service at the beginning
        of

        the next minute, this can result in leases that are one minute shorter than

        what the user might expect, as the end date is still specified by the

        client. Users who care about the exact timing of their leases should

        explicitly specify both start and end dates.
