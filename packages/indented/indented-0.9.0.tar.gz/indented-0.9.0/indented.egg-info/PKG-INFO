Description: # `indented`
        A library for generating Python code (and other indented text).
        
        Made for cases where the `ast` module is too fine-grained
        and gluing lines with newlines and tabs becomes too tedious.
        
        Currently, the documentation resides in the docstrings of `indented.text` and `indented.codegen`.
        Check them out on [github](https://github.com/lubieowoce/indented).
