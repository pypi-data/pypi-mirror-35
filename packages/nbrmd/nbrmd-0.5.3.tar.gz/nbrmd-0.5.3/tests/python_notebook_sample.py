# # Specifications for Jupyter notebooks as python scripts

# ## Markdown (and raw) cells

# Markdown cells are escaped with a single quote. Two consecutive
# cells are separated with a blank line. Raw cells are not
# distinguished from markdown.

# ## Code cells

# Code cells are separated by one blank line from markdown cells.
# If a code cells follows a comment, then that comment belong to the
# code cell.

# For instance, this is a code cell that starts with a
# code comment, split on multiple lines
1 + 2

# Code cells are terminated with either
# - end of file
# - two blank lines if followed by an other code cell
# - one blank line if followed by a markdown cell

# Code cells can have blank lines, but no two consecutive blank lines (unless
# a specific cell end is specified in the cell options, see below).
# Now we have a cell with multiple instructions

a = 3

a + 1

# And a cell with an arbitrary count of blank lines. This last example
# is also an instance of a cell with metadata information in json format,
# escaped with '#+' or '# +'

# + {"endofcell": "-"}
def f(x):
    return x + 1


def g(x):
    return x + 2
# -

# Cells after a cell with and explicit end-of-cell are just separated by one
# blank line
a + 2
