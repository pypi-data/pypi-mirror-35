0.5.0 (2018-08-21)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Jupyter magic commands escaped when exported (#29)
- 'endofcell' option for explicit (optional) end-of-cell marker (#31)
- 'active' cell option now supported for .py and .R export (#30)
- Raw cells now preserved when exported to .py or .R (#32)
- Extensions can be prefixed, like `.nb.py`, (mwouts/nbsrc#5)
- When a file with an extension not associated to 'ipynb' is opened and saved,
no 'ipynb' file is created (mwouts/nbsrc#5)
- Extensions can now be a sequence of groups. For instance,
`nbrmd_formats="ipynb,nb.py;script.ipynb,py"` will create an `ipynb` file
when a `nb.py` is opened (and conversely), and a `script.ipynb` file when a
`py` file is opened (mwouts/nbsrc#5)
- `nbsrc` script was moved to the `nbrmd` package. The `nbsrc` package now only
contains the documentation (mwouts/nbsrc#3)

- Documentation tells how to avoid creating `.ipynb` files #16

0.4.2 (2018-07-23)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

- Added test for R notebooks

**BugFixes**

`.ipynb`) that is found on disk

0.2.4 (2018-07-05)
+++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**

solved in Jupyter directly.
- New metadata 'main language' that preserves the notebook language.

**BugFixes**

- dependencies included in `setup.py`
