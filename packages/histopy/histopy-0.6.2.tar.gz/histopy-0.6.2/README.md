Quickstart: 
```
>>> import histopy as hp
>>> hp.history_full()     # like $ history
>>> hp.history()          # history of current session
>>> hp.recall(n)          # like $ !n
>>> hp.find('foo')        # print lines matching 'foo'
```

Known issues:
* recall_range(n1, n2) doesn't attempt to handle any exceptions. Would be nice
to prompt e.g. "recall_range stopped with exception ... on line ... Continue 
on line ...?"
