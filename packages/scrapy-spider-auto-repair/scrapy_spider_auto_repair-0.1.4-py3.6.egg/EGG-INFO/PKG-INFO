Summary: Spiders can become broken due to changes                 on the target site, which lead to different                 page layouts (therefore, broken XPath and                 CSS extractors). Often however, the information                 content of a page remains roughly similar, just                 in a different form or layout. This tool that can,                 in some fortunate cases, automatically infer                 extraction rules to keep a spider up-to-date                 with site changes.
