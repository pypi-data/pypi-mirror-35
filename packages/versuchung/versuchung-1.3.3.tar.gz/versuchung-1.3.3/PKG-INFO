Description: versuchung - a toolbox for experiments
        ======================================
        
        In some fields of science it is common practice to not publish any
        experiment descriptions or the raw measurement results of the
        experiment. This is not only opposed to the idea of science, where
        results should be reproducible to verify them by a larger audience,
        but also harmful for other researchers, who want to extend the results
        in the field.
        
        This lack of experiment descriptions and raw data is not necessary a
        result of mean intention by the original researcher, more a lack of
        tools for documenting and specifying experiements and the raw data
        analysis. This is especially true for some fields of computer
        science. But as these people are experts in using formal descriptions
        (also known as programming languages) it is surprising that there is
        no easy-to-use tool for specifying experiments and analyses.
        
        Versuchung tries to fill this gap, by providing such a tool, where
        experiments can be specified with proper input and output parameter
        declarations, versioned result sets and the possibility to process the
        result sets further.
