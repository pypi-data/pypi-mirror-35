Create Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a Micro plugin is very simple. All that you need to do is create a
file named ``interface.py`` which defines the plugin as follow:

.. code:: python

    from micro.plugin.pluginbase import PluginBase
    from micro.plugin.pluginbase import PluginDescription


    class ExamplePlugin(PluginBase):
        def __init__(self):
            print("This is an example plugin")

        # This is the method executed by Micro
        def run(self, name):
            return "Hello " + name + "!!!"


    # This description is required by Micro
    plugin = PluginDescription(
        instance=ExamplePlugin,
        name="Example Plugin",
        author="Jhon Doe",
        description="A very simple example plugin",
        long_description="This plugin is a very simple example, "
                         "for that reason, we don't have a long description",
        plugin_help="Params: name type string; A name to greet"
    )

Send tasks
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    >>> from micro.api.endpoints import Requests
    >>>
    >>> req = Requests(BROKER_URL, QUEUE_NAME)
    >>>
    >>> req.plugins.delay().wait()
    {'Example plugin': 'A very simple example plugin'}
    >>>
    >>> req.run.delay("Example plugin", name="Micro").wait()
    'Hello Micro!!!'
