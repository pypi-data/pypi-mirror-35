Description: # Project Flattener for Foliant
        
        This preprocessor converts a Foliant project source directory into a single Markdown file containing all the sources, preserving order and inheritance.
        
        This preprocessor is used by backends that require a single Markdown file as input instead of a directory. The Pandoc backend is one such example.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install foliantcontrib.flatten
        ```
        
        
        ## Config
        
        This preprocessor is required by Pandoc backend, so if you use it, you don't need to install Flatten or enable it in the project config manually.
        
        However, it's still a regular preprocessor, and you can run it manually by listing it in `preprocessors`:
        
        
        ```yaml
        preprocessors:
          - flatten
        ```
        
        The preprocessor has only one optionâ€”`flat_src_file_name`. It's the name of the flattened file that is created in the tmp directory:
        
        ```yaml
        preprocessors:
          - flatten:
              flat_src_file_name: flattened.md
        ```
        
        Default value is `__all__.md`.
        
        > **Note**
        >
        > Flatten preprocessor uses includes, so when you install Pandoc backend, Includes preprocessor will also be installed, along with Flatten.
