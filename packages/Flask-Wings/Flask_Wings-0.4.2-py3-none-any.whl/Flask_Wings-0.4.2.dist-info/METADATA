Flask-Wings is a boilerplate for writing Flask extensions.

Itself it is a tiny Flask extension that just adds some views and templates
to the parent app. An example of how to use it is in file ``tests/app.py``.

You can use Flask-Wings as a starting point for creating your own
Flask extensions as fully-fledged, distributable Python packages.

The minimalistic source code comes with a few extras you can use
to make your extension agree with
`standard practices <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/extensiondev>`_:

* tests directory with a minimal set of tests
* integration with `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/vmlaker/flask-wings>`_
* setuptools config
* top-level makefile
* etc.
