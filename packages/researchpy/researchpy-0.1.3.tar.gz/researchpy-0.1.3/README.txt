ResearchPy was developed to make using Python for academic research easier
for those that are not program savy. It essentially is a wrapper that combines
various established packages such as pandas, scipy, and statsmodels to get all
the standard required information in one. If analyses were not available in
either of those, code was developed to conduct that analysis. If analyses were
not available in the stated Python modules, then code was developed to fill
the gap.

All analyses and output has been tested and verified by comparing to established
software packages such as Stata, SAS, SPSS< and/or R.
