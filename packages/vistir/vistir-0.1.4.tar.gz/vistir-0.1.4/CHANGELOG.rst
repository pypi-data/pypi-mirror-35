0.1.4 (2018-08-18)
==================

Features
--------

- Implemented ``vistir.path.ensure_mkdir_p`` decorator for wrapping the output of a function call to ensure it is created as a directory.

  Added ``vistir.path.create_tracked_tmpdir`` functionality for creating a temporary directory which is tracked using an ``atexit`` handler rather than a context manager.  `#7 <https://github.com/sarugaku/vistir/issues/7>`_
