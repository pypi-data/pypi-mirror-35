Description: # Distances Calculator
        
        This is a distance calculator between 2 addressed, it is based on 
        *openstreetmap* api.
        
        ## Getting start
        
        ### requirements
        
        
        ### get distance between 2 addresses
        
        
        ### calculate the distance between a table's data
        
        ## How to calculate distance
        ### Based on coordinate
        Earth is a sphere, so we can use simple triangle function to 
        calculate a not accurate distance, but most of time, 
        this direct distance is good enough.
        
        ### Based on open street map api (in future)
        this can be used to calculate route distance.
