atomium
=======

atomium is a molecular modeller and file parser.

Example
-------

  >>> import atomium
  >>> pdb = atomium.fetch("5HVD")
  >>> pdb.model
  <Model (2156 atoms)>
  >>> pdb.model.chain("A")
  <Chain (204 residues)>





Installing
----------

pip
~~~

atomium can be installed using pip:

``$ pip3 install atomium``

atomium is written for Python 3, and does not support Python 2. It currently
requires Python 3.5 or above.

If you get permission errors, try using ``sudo``:

``$ sudo pip3 install atomium``


Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

The repository for atomium, containing the most recent iteration, can be
found `here <http://github.com/samirelanduk/atomium/>`_. To clone the
atomium repository directly from there, use:

``$ git clone git://github.com/samirelanduk/atomium.git``


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

atomium requires the Python library
`NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ (for now),
`paramiko <http://www.paramiko.org/>`_ and
`requests <https://docs.python-requests.org/>`_ - pip will install these
automatically when it installs atomium.


Overview
--------

atomium is a Python library for opening and saving .pdb, .cif and .xyz files,
and presenting and manipulating the information contained within.

Loading Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whist you can use atomium to create models from scratch to build an entirely
*de novo* structure, in practice you would generally use it to load molecular
data from an existing file...

	>>> import atomium
	>>> pdb1 = atomium.open('../1LOL.pdb')
	>>> xyz1 = atomium.open('/structures/glucose.xyz')
	>>> mmcif1 = atomium.open('/structures/1XDA.cif')
	>>> pdb2 = atomium.fetch('5HVD')
	>>> mmcif2 = atomium.fetch('5HVD.cif')

In that latter case, you don't need the file to be saved locally - it will just
go and grab the PDB with that code from the RCSB.

atomium will use the file extension you provide to decide how to parse it. If
there isn't one, or it doesn't recognise the extension, it will peek at the
file contents and try and guess whether it should be interpreted as .pdb, .cif
or .xyz.

The rest of this guide will focus on .pdb and .cif files. .xyz files are very
simple structures, and the only annotation they really contain is a ``.title``.

Using Data
~~~~~~~~~~

Once you've got your ``File`` object, what can you do with it?

Annotation
##########

There is various meta information contained within the ``File`` object.

    >>> pdb1.title
    'CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF OROTIDINE MONOPHOSPHATE DECARBOXYLASE COMPLEX WITH XMP'
    >>> pdb1.deposition_date
    datetime.date(2002, 5, 6)
    >>> pdb1.keywords
    ['TIM BARREL', 'LYASE']
    >>> pdb1.classification
    'LYASE'
    >>> pdb1.source_organism
    'METHANOTHERMOBACTER THERMAUTOTROPHICUS STR. DELTA H'
    >>> pdb1.resolution
    1.9
    >>> pdb1.rfactor
    0.193
    >>> pdb1.rfree
    0.229

atomium doesn't currently parse *every* bit of information from .pdb and .cif
files, but there is more than those shown above. See
`the full API docs <api/pdb.html>`_ for more details.

Models and Assembly
###################

All .pdb files contain one or more models - little universes containing a
molecular scene.

    >>> pdb1.model
    <Model (3431 atoms)>
    >>> pdb1.models
    (<Model (3431 atoms)>,)

Most just contain one - it's generally those that come from NMR experiments
which contain multiple models.

This model contains the 'asymmetric unit' - this is one or more protein
(usually) chains arranged in space, which may not be how the molecule arranges
itself in real life. It might just be how they arranged themselves in the
experiment. To create the 'real thing' from the asymmetric unit, you use
**biological assemblies.**

Most .pdb files contain one or more biological assemblies - instructions for how
to create a more realistic structure from the chains present, which in atomium
are accessed using ``File.biomolecules``.

In practice, what you need to know is that you can create a new model - not the
one already there containing the asymmetric unit - as follows...

    >>> pdb3 = atomium.fetch('1XDA')
    >>> pdb3.model
    <Model (1842 atoms)>
    >>> pdb3.generate_assembly(1)
    <Model (924 atoms)>
    >>> pdb3.generate_assembly(10)
    <Model (2730 atoms)>
    >>> pdb3.generate_best_assembly()
    <Model (5550 atoms)>

Here you load a .pdb with multiple possible assemblies, have a quick look at
the asymmetric unit with 1,842 atoms, generate two of its possible biological
assemblies by passing in their IDs, and then generate the 'best' of the
assemblies, which is the one with the lowest (that is, most negative) delta
free energy change as described in the .pdb file. In this case it is a hexameric
formation.

Model Contents
##############

The basic structures within a model are chains, residues, ligands, and atoms.

    >>> pdb1.model.chains()
    {<Chain (B, 1748 atoms)>, <Chain (A, 1683 atoms)>}
    >>> pdb1.model.chain('B')

The examples above demonstrate atomium's selection language. In the case of the
molecules - ``Model``, ``Chain``, ``Residue`` and
``Ligand`` - you can pass in an ``id`` or ``name``, or search by regex
pattern with ``id_regex`` or ``name_regex``.

Atoms have an even more powerful syntax. You can pass in *any* property of atoms
such as ``charge=1``, any comparitor of a property such as ``mass__lt=100``, or
any regex of a property such as ``name_regex='[^C]'``.

For pairwise comparisons, structures also have the
``AtomStructure.pairwise_atoms`` generator which will yield all
unique atom pairs in the structure. These can obviously get very big indeed - a
5000 atom PDB file would have about 12 million unique pairs.

Structures can be moved around and otherwise compared with each other...

    >>> pdb1.model.ligand(id='B2002').mass
    351.1022
    >>> pdb1.model.ligand(id='B2002').formula
    Counter({'C': 10, 'O': 9, 'N': 4, 'P': 1})
    >>> pdb1.model.ligand(id='B2002').nearby_atoms(2.8)

    {<Ligand HOH (B3155, 1 atom)>, <Ligand HOH (B3059, 1 atom)>, <Residue ASP (B

    >>> pdb1.model.ligand(id='B2002').rmsd_with(pdb1.model.ligand(id='A2001'))
    90.55588214099254
    >>> other_ligand = pdb1.model.ligand(id='A2001')
    >>> pdb1.model.ligand(id='B2002').rmsd_with(other_ligand)

    >>> pdb1.model.ligand(id='B2002').rmsd_with(other_ligand, superimpose=True)
    0.13325557235580035

Here we look at one of the ligands, identify its mass and molecular formula,
look at what atoms are within 2.8 Angstroms of it, and what residues are within
that same distance, rotate it and translate it through space, see where its new
center of mass is, and then finally get its RMSD with the other similar ligand
in the model - first using their locations 'as is', and then by seeing what the
RMSD would be if they were superimposed in such a way as to minimise RMSD.

The ``Atom`` objects themselves have their own useful properties.

    >>> pdb1.model.atom(97)
    <C (CA) Atom 97 at (-12.739, 31.201, 43.016)>
    >>> pdb1.model.atom(97).mass

    <Residue ASN (A23, 8 atoms)>
    >>> pdb1.model.atom(97).chain
    <Chain (A, 1683 atoms)>

Chains are a bit different from other structures in that they are iterable,
indexable, and return their residues as a tuple, not a set...

    >>> pdb1.model.atom(97).chain
    <Chain (A, 1683 atoms)>
    >>> pdb1.model.chain('A')
    <Chain (A, 1683 atoms)>
    >>> len(pdb1.model.chain('A'))

    <Residue LEU (A21, 8 atoms)>
    >>> pdb1.model.chain('A').residues()[:5]
    (<Residue VAL (A11, 7 atoms)>, <Residue MET (A12, 8 atoms)>, <Residue ASN (A
    13, 8 atoms)>, <Residue ARG (A14, 11 atoms)>, <Residue LEU (A15, 8 atoms)>)
    >>> pdb1.model.chain('A').sequence
    'VMNRLILAMDLMNRDDALRVTGEVREYIDTVKIGYPLVLSEGMDIIAEFRKRFGCRIIADFKVADIPETNEKICR

    PE'

In those latter two cases, two different sequences are returned. The first just
returns the sequence of residues actually present in the model, whereas the
second is the 'real' sequence that exists in nature. Some of them will be
missing from the model for practical reasons.

Residues can generate name information based on their three letter code, and are
aware of their immediate neighbors.

    >>> pdb1.model.residue('A100')
    <Residue PHE (A100, 11 atoms)>
    >>> pdb1.model.residue('A100').name
    'PHE'
    >>> pdb1.model.residue('A100').code
    'F'
    >>> pdb1.model.residue('A100').full_name
    'phenylalanine'
    >>> pdb1.model.residue('A100').next
    <Residue PRO (A101, 7 atoms)>
    >>> pdb1.model.residue('A100').previous
    <Residue GLY (A99, 4 atoms)>

Saving Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

A model can be saved to file using:

  >>> model.save("new.xyz")
  >>> model.save("new.pdb")

Any structure can be saved in this way, so you can save chains or molecules to
their own seperate files if you so wish.

(Currently atomium doesn't support .cif saving, but that is planned for a future
release.)

  >>> model.chain("A").save("chainA.pdb")
  >>> model.chain("B").save("chainB.pdb")
  >>> model.ligand(name="XMP").save("ligand.xyz")

The ``File`` object itself can also be saved:

  >>> pdb.title = "Modified PDB"
  >>> pdb.save("new.pdb")

Note that if the model you are saving is one from a biological assembly, it will
likely have many duplicated IDs, so saving to file may create unexpected
results.
