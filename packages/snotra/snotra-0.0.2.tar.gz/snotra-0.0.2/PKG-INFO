Description: 
            **Snotra - Health registry research using Pandas and Python**
            
            Snotra is a tool that extends and builds on the Pandas library to make it easier to analyze data on hospital events, prescriptions and similar types of health data.
        
            Example: 
            To count the number of persons with a diagnosis starting with 'K50' in a dataframe with many events per person:
                df.count_persons('K50*', cols='icd')
            Snotra is also a Norse goddess associated with the Norse word for clever. Although the library is related to health research, the Norse term is in no way connected to snot
