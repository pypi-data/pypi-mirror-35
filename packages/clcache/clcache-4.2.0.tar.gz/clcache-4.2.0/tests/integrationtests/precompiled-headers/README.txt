The tutorial was writte a decade ago using MSVC 2005, so the author
had to adjust a lot of things to make it run using modern compilers.

It is suspected that the original content from Microsoft does not
satisfy the threshold of originality. All modifications are licensed
the same way as the rest of the clcache project.
