        For the Voronoi pixelizations, a cluster set of 'cluster-pixels' are used to determine the pixelization. \
        These provide the mappings between only a sub-set of sub-pixels / image-pixels and pixels.

        To determine the complete set of sub-pixel to pixel mappings, we must therefore pair every sub-pixel to \
        its nearest pixel (using the sub-pixel's pix-plane coordinate and pixel center). Using a full \
        nearest neighbor search to do this is slow, thus the pixel neighbors (derived via the Voronoi grid) \
        is used to localize each nearest neighbor search.

        In this routine, some variables and function names refer to a 'cluster_pix_'. This term describes a \
        pixel that we have paired to a sub_coordinate using the cluster_coordinate of an image coordinate. \
