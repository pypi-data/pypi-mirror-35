        USAGE
        -----
        This script is for recalculating in output from a VINDTA.
        
        1. Read in the .dbs file and associated .dat files with the `dbs_to_excel()` function. The script creates an excel file if a  filename is given, else only a `pandas.DataFrame` is returned.
        2. Columns for nutrients are added to the excel file. These should be filled out before running the second recalculation step where CRMs are used to calibrate the data.
        3. Run the CRM recalculation step with the function `recalculate_CO2_from_excel`. The recalculation is performed without you having to do anything :) The data will be saved in the excel file in a second tab.
        
        
        NOTES
        -----
        This was written for the CSIR's VINDTA #18 and #35.
        There are thus headers that may need to be changed.
        These headers can be changed manually in the dbs_to_excel
        function using the header keyword argument. Be very
        careful when changing this. It needs to match your
        VINDTA's column headers.
        
        
        TO DO
        -----
        - add documentation for the functions. A little sparse at the moment.
        - write additional info in the output excel file.
