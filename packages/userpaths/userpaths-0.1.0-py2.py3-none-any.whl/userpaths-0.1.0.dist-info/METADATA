The userpaths module provides cross-platform access to a user's special
folders (or directories) like My Documents, Desktop, and Application Data.

On Windows, it uses SHGetFolderPath() from shell32.dll. On other platforms,
it provides the closest standard or generally-used de facto equivalent.

The API is based on Ryan Ginstrom's winpaths [1], an existing module that
provides a Windows-specific solution to special folder access. However,
userpaths has a different overall focus (cross-platform access to a subset
of user folders), and is not intended as an exact drop-in replacement.

A quick usage example:

    # Get the user's My Documents folder
    import userpaths
    my_docs = userpaths.get_my_documents()
