Description: # Probabilistic Spell Checker in Python
        
        Spell checker based on edit distance (Levenshtein-ish) and word frequency
        in a training corpus.
        
            For theoretical background, see Peter Norvig's article,
        https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html
        
        Comes with a dictionary trained from German Wikipedia articles.
        
        Usage:
        
            import json
            import re
            import probspellchecker
        
            spellchecker = probspellchecker.ProbabilisticSpellChecker(
                word_counts=json.load(open("dictionary_dewiki_full10plus.json")),
                word_whitelist=["my", "custom", "wordlist"],
            )
        
            text = "lorem ipsum whatever"
            for word in re.findall(r"\w+", text):
                correction = spellchecker.correction(word.lower())
                if correction:
                    print(correction)
                else:
                    print(word)
        
        Word counts is just that, a dict with word to count mapping. To build your
        own dictionaries, see probdict-from-dewiki.py and probdict-from-text.py.
        You may also specify a whitelist of words that should just be accepted by
        the spell checker, which is useful if your name is not in the dictionary.
        
        If your language sports special characters like the German umlauts, you
        might need to pass an additional charset parameter which is a string with
        all allowed characters of your language, to the ProbabilisticSpellChecker.
        This is then used to generate candidate words.
        
        ## Logging
        
        If the logging annoys you, just shut it up:
        
            spell_log = logging.getLogger("probspellchecker")
            spell_log.setLevel(logging.ERROR)  # log only errors
