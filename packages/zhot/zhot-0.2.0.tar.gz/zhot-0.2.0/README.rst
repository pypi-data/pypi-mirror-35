Zhot
======

I had some fun teaching myself Perl with my Rock-Paper-Scissors script
over at https://bitbucket.org/AmyDeeDempster/rock-paper-scissors

This is a more extensible version in Python, done in a more mathematical
and object-oriented manner.

Usage
------

### Establishing game rules

Supply a Comma-Separated Values file as a command-line argument for this
script. For example:

``zhot moves/moves-5.csv``

If not supplied, a default set of three-move rules will be used.

### Gameplay and user input

In the game, type the name of the move you wish to play. This can be
abbreviated.

Other commands available include:

-  ``rules`` or ``help``
-  ``score``
-  ``rounds``
-  ``diagram``
-  ``exit`` or ``quit``

You can also just hit Return to quit the game.

### Rule diagram

The ``diagram`` command generates, from the rules of the current game
a vector diagram illustrating those rules.

Dependencies
