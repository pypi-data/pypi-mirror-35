Description: # plexiglas
        
        This piece of software was inspired by me buying the [WD My Passport Wireless Pro](https://www.wdc.com/products/portable-storage/my-passport-wireless-pro.html),
        quite nice external hdd which is able to run [Plex](https://plex.tv) and stream all available
        media across connected wireless devices. The only remarkable problem was is requirement
        to manually copy required content to hdd, at least when you already have some instance
        of Plex set up. But now, with plexiglas, you can easily have multiple servers with similar data.
