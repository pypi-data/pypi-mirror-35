      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

Description: # PowerfulSeal
        
        __PowerfulSeal__ adds chaos to your Kubernetes clusters, so that you can detect problems in your systems as early as possible. It kills targeted pods and takes VMs up and down.
        
        It follows the [Principles of Chaos Engineering](http://principlesofchaos.org/), and is inspired by [Chaos Monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey).
        
        Embrace the inevitable failure. __Embrace The Seal__.

        [Watch us introduce the Seal at Kubecon 2017 Austin](https://youtu.be/00BMn0UjsG4)
        
        ## Highlights
        
        - works with `OpenStack`, `AWS` and local machines
        - speaks `Kubernetes` natively
        - interactive and autonomous, policy-driven mode
        - metric collection and exposition to `Prometheus`
        - minimal setup, easy yaml-based policies
        - easy to extend
        
        
        ## Introduction
        
        __PowerfulSeal__ works in two modes: interactive and autonomous.
        
        __Interactive__ mode is designed to allow you to discover your cluster's components, and manually break things to see what happens. It operates on nodes, pods, deployments and namespaces.
        
        __Autonomous__ mode reads a policy file, which can contain any number of pod and node scenarios. Each scenario describes a list of matches, filters and actions to execute on your cluster.
        
        ## Interactive mode
        
        Here's a sneak peek of what you can do in the interactive mode:
        
        ![demo nodes](./media/video-nodes.gif)
        
        ![demo pods](./media/video-pods.gif)
        
        
        ## Autonomous mode
        
        Autonomous reads the scenarios to execute from the policy file, and runs them:
        
        1. The matches are combined together and deduplicated to produce an initial working set
        2. They are run through a series of filters
        3. For all the items remaining after the filters, all actions are executed
        
        ![pipeline](./media/pipeline.png)
        
        ### Metric Collection
        
        Autonomous mode also comes with the ability for metrics useful for monitoring to be collected. PowerfulSeal currently has a `stdout` and Prometheus collector. However, metric collectors are easily extensible so it is easy to add your own. More details can be found [here](METRICS.md).
        
        ## Writing policies
        
        A minimal policy file, doing nothing, looks like this:
        
        ```yaml
        config:
          minSecondsBetweenRuns: 77
          maxSecondsBetweenRuns: 100
        
        nodeScenarios: []
        
        podScenarios: [] 
        ```
        
        The schemas are validated against the [powerful JSON schema](./powerfulseal/policy/ps-schema.json)
        
        A [full featured example](./tests/policy/example_config.yml) listing most of the available options can be found in the [tests](./tests/policy).
        
        ## Setup
        
        
        Setup includes:
        - pointing PowerfulSeal at your Kubernetes cluster by giving it a Kubernetes config file
        - pointing PowerfulSeal at your cloud by specifying the cloud driver to use and providing credentials
        - making sure that PowerfulSeal can SSH into the nodes to execute commands on them
        - writing a set of policies
        
        These interactions are available:
        
        ![pipeline](./media/setup.png)
        
        ## Getting started
        
        `PowerfulSeal` is available to install through pip:
        
        ```sh
        pip install powerfulseal
        powerfulseal --help # or seal --help
        ```
        
        Both Python 2.7 and Python 3 are supported.
        
        ## Testing
        
        PowerfulSeal uses [tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox) to test with multiple versions on Python. The recommended setup is to install and locally activate the Python versions under `tox.ini` with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). 
        
        Once the required Python versions are set up and can be discovered by tox (e.g., by having them discoverable in your PATH), you can run the tests by running `tox`.

        ## FAQ
        
        ### Where can I learn more about Chaos Engineering ?
        
        We found these two links to be a good start:
        
        - http://principlesofchaos.org/
        - https://github.com/dastergon/awesome-chaos-engineering
        
        ### How is it different from Chaos Monkey ?
        
        PowerfulSeal was inspired by Chaos Monkey, but it differs in a couple of important ways.
        
        The Seal does:
          - speak Kubernetes
          - offer flexible, easy to write YAML scenarios
          - provide interactive mode with awesome tab-completion
        
        The Seal doesn't:
          - need external dependencies (db, Spinnaker), apart from SSH, cloud and Kubernetes API access
          - need you to setup ```cron```
        
        ### Can I contribute to The Seal ?
        
        We would love you to. In particular, it would be great to get help with:
        
        - get more [cloud drivers](./powerfulseal/clouddrivers/driver.py) (currently `OpenStack` and `AWS`)
        - get more [awesome filters](./powerfulseal/policy/scenario.py)
        - __get an amazing logo__
        - make the PowerfulSeal more powerful
        
        Check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information about how to contribute.
        
        ### Why a Seal ?
        
        It might have been inspired by [this comic](https://randowis.com/2015/01/07/the-tower/).
