----------------

PYISA is a a basic intent based project structuring approach which classifies the intents in to 3 basic ISA Zones:
1. Business Objectives
2. Problem Formulation
3. Solution Designing

This classification approach is build to ensure that all the important aspects of the project structuring are covered.
