Description: This is pynng.
        ==============
        
        Ergonomic bindings for [nanomsg next generation] \(nng), in Python.
        pynng provides a nice interface on top of the full power of nng.  nng, and
        therefore pynng, make it easy to communicate between processes on a single
        computer or computers across a network.
        
        Goals
        =====
        
        Provide a Pythonic, works-out-of-the box library on Windows and Unix-y
        platforms.  Like nng itself, the license is MIT, so it can be used without
        restriction.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        On Windows and 64-bit Linux, the usual
        
            pip install pynng
        
        should suffice.  Building from source is a little convoluted, due to some
        issues with the way the setup.py script is written.  Nevertheless, it can be
        done:
        
            git clone https://github.com/codypiersall/pynng
            cd pynng
            pip install .
            python setup.py build
            python setup.py build_ext --inplace
            pytest
        
        Installing on Mac
        -----------------
        
        This project does not yet know how to build for Mac, because I don't have a Mac
        to test on.  The tricky bit is letting cffi know the correct object file to
        link to, and ensuring whatever the Mac equivalent of -fPIC is set when
        compiling.
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * Support Mac
        * More docs
