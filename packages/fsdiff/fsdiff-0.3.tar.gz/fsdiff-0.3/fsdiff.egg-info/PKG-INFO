Description: # NAME 
        
        fsdiff - A tool to compare filesystems or local disk images. It performs both a content analysis and a 
        It can mount and compare two images locally or it can just compare two filesystems.
        
        # SYNOPSIS
        
        `fsdiff [-h] [-v] [--fs-from PATH_FS1] [--fs-to PATH_FS2]`
        
        # DESCRIPTION
        
        fsdiff is a very simple tool used to compare recursively the filesystem directory and file structure.
        It does not only perform a quick (shallow) comparison using `os.stat` (stat system call), it also compares 
        the contents of the files. 
        
        In case they differ, it displays a brief summary report. It is also installed
        as a Python packaged, so it can be used likewise.
        
        Example run:
        `fsdiff ./fs1 ./fs2`
        
        For a more detailed investigation  a deep checking tool like 
        diffoscope or Beyond Compare, may be used.
        
        To install you need to run `pip3 install fsdiff`, with either super
        user privileges or with the `--user` flag.
        
        Note: Python 3.x is required, a few new language features are used, like `subprocess.run` method as well as the cache
         clearing from the directory compare library. It also needs to be run with super user privileges.
