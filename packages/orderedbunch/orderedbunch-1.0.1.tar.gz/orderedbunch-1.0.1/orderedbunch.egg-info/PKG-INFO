Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The is a simplification and redesign of the orderedbunch package from tinytools.
        The package ontains an OrderedBunch object class with associated
        bunchify/unbunchify methods, similar to other bunch implementations but
        built off an OrderedDict with ipython table-complete overloaded to the
        data memebers.  It removes the ``ordered_dictionarify`` function that is in
        tinytools and and leaves the development of the nested dictionaries to
        external code.  The motivation is that it is quite complicated to infer what
        the user is wanting - and therefore error prone.
        
        IPython has also recently changed its handling of the ``__dir__`` method and it
        is unclear under which cases it is respected for tab completion or not.  It
        seems, though, that for ipython 6, it is possible to remove mothods from
        the tab completion through the ``IPCompleter.*`` configuration options.

            pip install orderedbunch
        
        Import
        =======
        
        .. code:: python

        Quick Start
        ===========
        .. code:: python
        
            from orderedbunch import OrderedBunch
        
            ## OrderedBunch
            from collections import OrderedDict
        
            # Create an OrderedBunch from and return it to an OrderedDict
            od = OrderedDict({'a':1,'b':2,'c':{'aa':1.23,'bb':'string'}})
            ob = orderedbunch.ordered_bunchify(od)
            ob.a          # Explore the OrderdBunch with tab complete
            ob['a']       # Equivalent to above
            ob.c.bb       # orderd_bunchify is recursive on nested Dict objects
            ob['c']['bb'] # Equivalent to above
            od2 = tt.bunch.ordered_unbunchify(ob)
