Description: # Omnis
        Deep Learning for everyone
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## You have just found Omnis.
        
        Omnis is an API of neural network applications, written in Python and capable of running on top of [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast application of deep learning.
        
        Use Omnis if you need a deep learning library that:
        
        - Is EASY to learn and use.
        - Allows for easy and fast prototyping.
        - Supports CNN, LSTM, GAN, RL and etc.(TBA)
        - Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
        
        Omnis is compatible with: __Python 2.7-3.6__.
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## Guiding principles
        
        - __Simplicity.__ Omnis pursues a simple architecture. Designing a software with simple architecture not only helps you to understand the code easily but also helps your painful debugging.
        
        - __Easiness.__ Don't worry about complicated algorithms or theories or mathematics. Omnis will handle difficult stuffs for you. Just learn how to use deep neural network and USE THIS!
        
        - __Modularity.__ No spaghetti code!
        
        ------------------
        
        
        ## Why this name, Omnis?
        
        Omnis means _EVERY_ in Latin. The goal of Omnis is to make deep learning technologies easier so that _EVERY_ one can use deep learning technologies without headache.
