# Prerequisite

You need Python 3.6 or later to run icxcli. You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.

On macOS(Sierra and after) and Ubuntu 16.04, for example, the necessary packages are:

- automake
- pkg-config
- virtualenv
- autoconf
- libtool

In Ubuntu 16.04, you can install Python 3.6.

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install python3.6
    $ sudo apt install python3.6-dev
    $ sudo apt install virtualenv
    $ virtualenv -p python3.6 .venv

You can install pip3 for python 3.6 like this:

    $ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
    $ sudo python3.6 get-pip.py

You can install autoconf, libtool and automake for python3.6.

    $ sudo apt install autoconf libtool automake



# Version

- 0.0.4



# Glossary

- Address of wallet: Unique string to identify the address to transfer value. It prefixed with 'hx'.
- Private key: A tiny bit of code that is paired with a public key to set off algorithms to encrypt and decrypt a text for the specific address.
- Public key: Long alphanumeric characters that is used to encrypt data (message).



# Technical information

## Private key, public key and wallet address

There are five steps to get from  private->public -> address:

1. Generate a private key.
2. Derive a public key from the private key.
3. H1 = sha3_256( Public key)  => 32 byte
4. BitAddress = last 20 bytes of H1
5. Address = hx || HexString(BitAddress)
ex) hxaa688d74eb5f98b577883ca203535d2aa4f0838c

## Tested platform

We tested on window and macOS. If you find some problems on window, please send the report of the problems.



# Getting started

## Installation

The easiest way to install icxcli* is to use pip:

    $ pip install icxcli

or, if you are not installing in a virtualenv:

    $ sudo pip install icxcli

If you have the aws-cli installed and want to upgrade to the latest version you can run:

    $ pip install --upgrade icxcli

## Run CLI

Run command icli in the command line.  There are many sub commands like wallet create, wallet show, asset list, transfer for ICX service. You can get the help page by adding the command help.

    $ icli  --help
    usage:
            Normal commands:
                version
                help

            Wallet Commands:

                wallet create <file path> -p <password>
                wallet show <file path> -p <password>    | -n <network : mainnet | testnet | IP or domain>
                asset list <file path> -p <password>     | -n <network : mainnet | testnet | IP or domain>
                transfer <to> <amount> <file path> -p <password> -f <fee=10000000000000000> | -n  <network : mainnet | testnet | IP or domain>

            WARNING:

                Fee feature is the experimental feature; fee is fixed to 10000000000000000 loop for now so if you
                try to make a transaction with the modified fee, which is not 10000000000000000 loop, then you would
                not be able to make the transaction. you will be notified
                when it is possible to make a transaction with the modified fee.

            IF YOU MISS -n, icli WILL USE TESTNET.


    positional arguments:
      command           wallet create, wallet show, asset list, transfer

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help		show this help message and exit
