Description: 
        *PhysicalQuantities* is a Python module that allows calculations to be aware of physical units. Built-in unit
        conversion ensures that calculations will result in the correct unit.
        
        The main goals are:
         * easy use, especially conversion, scaling and interoperating with different units
         * focus on using units for engineering tasks
         * provide logarithmic dB calculations
         * allow seamless Numpy array operation
        
        The module also contains an extension for IPython. This allows much simplified usage by typing in physical quantities
        as number and unit:
        
            >>> a = 1m ; b = 1s
            >>> print("a=", a, ", b=",b,", a/b=", a/b)
            a= 1 m , b= 1 s , a/b= 1.0 m/s
            >>> u = 10V
            >>> u.dB
            >>> 20.0 dBV
