## Installation

First, you need Python installed, either [Python2.7.+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Python3.+](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Either versions are good for our purpose. Then, we are going to use a package management system to install [PyLUCCBA](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA), namely [pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)), _already installed if you are using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4_. Open a session in your OS shell prompt and type

    pip install pyluccba

Or using a non-python-builtin approach, namely [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads),

    git clone git://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA.git
    cd PyLUCCBA
    python setup.py install 


## Example usage
    
*The example that follows is done with the idea of reproducing the results presented in Dupoux (2018) via the Python Shell*.

Let's first import the module `PyLUCCBA`

    >>> import PyLUCCBA as cc

The alias of `PyLUCCBA`, namely `cc`, actually contains many objects definitions, such as that of the calculator that we are going to use in examples. The name of the calculator is `CBACalculator`.

But before using the calculator as such, let's define (and introduce) the set of parameters that we are going to use to configure `CBACalculator`. As can be expected when performing a cost benefit analysis, these parameters are related to: *(i)* the horizon of the project, *(ii)* the discount rate that we want to use in our calculations, *(iii)* the scenarized price trajectory of carbon dioxide, *(iv)* the scenarized trajectory of quantities of bio-ethanol to produce annually and *(...)* so on. Let's introduce them all in practice:

    >>> cba = cc.CBACalculator(
            run_name               = 'Example-1',
            country                = 'france',
            project_first_year     = 2020,
            project_horizon        = 20,
            discount_rate          = .03,
            co2_prices_scenario    = 'SPC',
            output_flows_scenario  = 'O',
            initial_landuse        = 'improved grassland',
            final_landuse          = 'wheat',
            input_flows_scenario   = 'IFP',
            T_so                   = 20,
            T_vg_diff              = 1,
            T_vg_unif              = 20,
            polat_repeated_pattern = True,
            final_currency         = 'EUR',
            change_rates           = {'EUR':{'USD/EUR':1.14}}, # https://www.google.fr/#q=EUR+USD
            return_plts            = True,
        )

The following table enumerates all parameters that can be used to create an instance of `CBACalculator`.

 Parameter's name         | and description
 ------------------------ | -------
 `run_name`               | name of the folder that will contain the generated results and charts, *e.g.* `'introduction example 1'`.
 `country`                | name of the country under study. Only *one* possible choice currently: `France`.
 `project_first_year`     | first year of the project.
 `project_horizon`        | duration of the biofuel production project (years).
 `discount_rate`          | rate involved in the calculations of net present values. Set to `0.` by default.
 `co2_prices_scenario`    | name of the trajectory of carbon (dioxide) prices. The current choices are `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, `'DEBUG'`, `'O'`, `'SPC'`, `'WEO2015-450S'`, `'WEO2015-CPS'` or `'WEO2015-NPS'`.
 `output`                 | name of the produced biofuel. Set to `'eth'` by default. Only *one* possible choice currently: `'eth'`. ***NB***: `'eth'` actually stands for **bio**ethanol.
 `black_output`           | name of the counterfactual produced output. Serves as the reference according to which the production of bioethanol (`'eth'`) is considered (or not) as pro-environmental. Set to `'oil'` by default. Only *one* possible choice currently: `'oil'`. ***NB***: `'oil'` actually stands for gasoline.
 `output_flows_scenario`  | name of the trajectory of annually produced quantities of biofuel. The current choices are `'DEBUG'` or `'O'`.
 `initial_landuse`        | use of the land *before* land conversion. The current choices are `'forestland30'`, `'improved grassland'`, `'annual cropland'` or `'degraded grassland'`.
 `final_landuse`          | use of the land *after* land conversion. The current choices are `'miscanthus'`, `'sugarbeet'` or `'wheat'`.
 `input_flows_scenario`   | name of the trajectory of input-to-ouput yields. The current choices depend on the value set for `final_landuse`. If `final_landuse` is set to `'miscanthus'`, the possibilities are `'DEBUG'` and `'DOE'`. If `final_landuse` is set to `'wheat'` or `'sugarbeet'`, the possibilities are `'IFP'` and `'DEBUG'`.
 `T_so`                   | period over which soil carbon emissions due to LUC are considered.
 `T_vg_diff`              | period over which vegetation carbon emissions due to LUC are considered in the differentiated annualization approach.
 `T_vg_unif`              | period over which vegetation carbon emissions due to LUC are considered in the uniform annualization approach.
 `polat_repeated_pattern` | if `True`, retro/extra-polation pattern is repeated before/after the first/last mentioned value. Otherwise, it is maintained constant.
 `final_currency`         | currency used to express the results. The current choices are `'EUR'` or `'USD'`. Set to `'EUR'` by default.
 `change_rates`           | `final_currency`-dependent exchange rate value to consider in calculations, *e.g.* `{'EUR':{'USD/EUR':1.14,}}` *(or `{'EUR':{'EUR/USD':0.8772,}}` since the tool ensures dimensional homogeneity)*.
 `return_plts`            | if `True`, charts are returned (for interactive use). Otherwise, they are saved or shown to users depending on the value set for `save_charts`. Set to `False` by default.
 `save_charts`            | if `True` charts are saved on the disk. Otherwise, they are shown to users. Set to `True` by default. **NB** `return_plts=True` has priority over `save_charts`.

Once we have our instance of `CBACalculator` in hand, *i.e.* `cba`, we may wonder what are the scenarized trajectories over which we are about to conduct our study, *e.g.* of carbon dioxide prices, produced quantities of biofuel, etc. In this case, we can simply type:

    >>> cba.chart_of_output_flows_traj.show()

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/FLOWS%20TONNES%20ETH%20%5BO%5D.png?raw=true" width="60%"/><img></p>

As it reads in the above chart, we are about to work with a constant level of production over the project horizon. Note the abscence of flow in 2020: this illustrates the need for waiting one year before having enough wheat to produce biofuel. We may wonder what is the counterfactual trajectory in terms of gasoline -- targeting the same [energy efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency) (in joule) as conversion basis: 

    >>> cba.chart_of_black_output_flows_traj.show()

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/FLOWS%20TONNES%20OIL%20%5BO%5D.png?raw=true" width="60%"/><img></p>

Now, let's see which trajectory of carbon dioxide prices is behind the name `'SPC'` -- which stands for [Quinet (2009)](http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/storage/rapports-publics/094000195.pdf)'s shadow price of carbon:

    >>> cba.chart_of_co2_prices_traj.show()

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/PRICES%20co2%20%5BSPC%5D.png?raw=true" width="60%"/><img></p>

We may also wonder which quantities trajectory of wheat is implied by that of biofuel on the one hand, and by the value we set for the parameter `input_flows_scenario`, that is `'IFP'` , on the other hand -- where *I.F.P* stands for *Institut Français du Pétrole énergies nouvelles* -- which made a report in [2013](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/resources/yields/Input/Input.txt) in which it reads that, with 1 tonne of wheat, one can produce [0.2844](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/resources/yields/Input/WHEAT_yields_FR.csv) tonnes of bioethanol. Let's vizualize that:

    >>> cba.chart_of_input_flows_traj.show()

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/FLOWS%20TONNES%20input%20%5BIFP%5D%5BWHEAT%5D.png?raw=true" width="60%"/><img></p>

The land use change from `initial_landuse='improved grassland'` to `final_landuse='wheat'` has effects in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. These emissions clearly don't exhibit the same profile depending on how we choose to consider them over the project horizon. First, regarding soil carbon dioxide emissions:

    >>> cba.carbon_and_co2_flows_traj_annualizer.so_emitting
    True
    >>> cba.chart_of_soco2_unif_flows_traj.show()
    >>> cba.chart_of_soco2_diff_flows_traj.show()
    ---- a_parameter_which_solves_soc_chosen_CRF_constrained sol=[0.52418009]
    ---- [***]The solution converged.[0.000000e+00][***]
    
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/FLOWS%20TONNES%20co2%20so%20%5Bunif-IMPROVED%20GRASSLAND~WHEAT%5D.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/FLOWS%20TONNES%20co2%20so%20%5Bdiff-IMPROVED%20GRASSLAND~WHEAT%5D.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img></p>

Of course, the comparison makes sense since the total emitted stocks are identical:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.sum(cba.soco2_unif_flows_traj)
    -10.90041830757967 # tonnes
    >>> np.sum(cba.soco2_diff_flows_traj)
    -10.90041830757967 # tonnes
    
On the side of vegetation-related emissions, converting grassland into wheat field generates a loss of carbon since the latter is harvested annually while the former sequestrates carbon on a pertpetual basis. Here again, emissions' profiles are clearly different under differentiated or uniform anualization approach, see 

    >>> cba.carbon_and_co2_flows_traj_annualizer.vg_emitting
    True
    >>> cba.chart_of_vgco2_unif_flows_traj.show()
    >>> np.sum(cba.vgco2_unif_flows_traj)
    -7.130970463238133 # tonnes
    >>> cba.chart_of_vgco2_diff_flows_traj.show()
    ---- a_parameter_which_solves_vgc_chosen_CRF_constrained sol=[0.02458071]
    ---- [***]The solution converged.[0.000000e+00][***]
    >>> np.sum(cba.vgco2_diff_flows_traj)
    -7.130970463238132 # tonnes
    
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/FLOWS%20TONNES%20co2%20vg%20%5Bunif-IMPROVED%20GRASSLAND~WHEAT%5D.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/FLOWS%20TONNES%20co2%20vg%20%5Bdiff-IMPROVED%20GRASSLAND~WHEAT%5D.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img></p>

Independently of how we annualize the LUC-related carbon dioxide emissions, the cultivation and the processing of wheat generate emissions annually as well. See

    >>> cba.chart_of_cult_input_co2eq_flows_traj.show()
    >>> cba.chart_of_proc_input_co2eq_flows_traj.show()
    
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/FLOWS%20TONNES%20co2eq%20%5Bcult-WHEAT%5D.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/FLOWS%20TONNES%20co2eq%20%5Bproc-WHEAT%5D.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img></p>

Note that the emissions shown above are in *CO2eq* since *CH4* and *N2O* flows are considered as well, using as a basis of conversion, their global warming potentials relatively to that of *CO2*. See calculation details at [PyGWP](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyGWP). 

Finally the total emissions following a change in land use from improved grassland into wheat field are -- under the two types of annualization approach:

    >>> cba.chart_of_total_unif_co2_flows_traj.show()
    >>> cba.chart_of_total_diff_co2_flows_traj.show()

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/FLOWS%20TONNES%20co2%20total%20%5Bunif-ETH%5D.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/FLOWS%20TONNES%20co2%20total%20%5Bdiff-ETH%5D.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img></p>

which, when monetized with a non-zero discount rate and compared in terms of absolute deviations from gasoline's valorized CO2 flows, lead to sensitivly different profile for the values of the project, see rather

    >>> cba.chart_of_NPV_total_unif_minus_black_output_co2_flows_trajs.show()
    >>> cba.chart_of_NPV_total_diff_minus_black_output_co2_flows_trajs.show()
    
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/dNPV%20co2%20total%20%5Bunif-SPC-ETHvsOIL%5D.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/dNPV%20co2%20total%20%5Bdiff-SPC-ETHvsOIL%5D.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img></p>

Actually, it looks like extending the horizon of the project may be a good idea to see whether one of those two temporal profiles exhibit positive values over the long run.

    >>> cba._cache.clear() # we clear the cache of our instance since we are going to change a calculation parameter.
    >>> cba.project_horizon = 40 # double the project horizon
    >>> cba.chart_of_NPV_total_unif_minus_black_output_co2_flows_trajs.show()
    >>> cba.chart_of_NPV_total_diff_minus_black_output_co2_flows_trajs.show()
    ---- a_parameter_which_solves_soc_chosen_CRF_constrained sol=[0.52418009]
    ---- [***]The solution converged.[0.000000e+00][***]
    ---- a_parameter_which_solves_vgc_chosen_CRF_constrained sol=[0.02458071]
    ---- [***]The solution converged.[0.000000e+00][***]
    
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/dNPV%20co2%20total%20%5Bunif-SPC-ETHvsOIL%5D-extended.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img><img src="https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/examples/Example-1/dNPV%20co2%20total%20%5Bdiff-SPC-ETHvsOIL%5D-extended.png?raw=true" width="50%"/><img></p>

Put differently,

    >>> cba.unif_payback_period
    40 # years
    >>> cba.diff_payback_period
    35 # years

## Value of the data

•	The calculator offers a compilation of environmental and economic data to generate environment-related net present values of any project with impacts to the environment (GHG emissions or sequestrations).

•	The calculator is coded in [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (compatible with both versions: 2 and 3). [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is a cross platform and a comprehensive extensible and editable language with a large community of users.

•	The structure of the code is simple with accessible input data to which it is possible to add or suppress one’s own trajectories (of prices, carbon stocks, etc).

•	The compensatory rate (see the paper for more information) can be calculated easily with the tool.

•	Note that constant returns to scale (biofuel production) are assumed in the tool.


## Data

  Raw data from the public repository as listed above are first used in the “Data_CarbonStocks_Emissions” Excel file to generate (i) land use change carbon stock changes for the scenarios studied in the paper, and (ii) emissions from the process and cultivation of bioethanol. This data is then directly used in the tool (either in the “resources” folder or the code) which is described below. The output data is not directly provided but as explained below, it can be generated easily with the “ready-to-use” study cases provided.

## Materials and Methods

  The calculator, as such, is divided into two (tested and documented) python scripts, namely [core.py](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/core.py) and another that contains non-thematic-specific functions and classes, [tools.py](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/core.py). The scripts that must be used to obtain the *results* presented in [Dupoux (2016)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304170193_The_land_use_change_time-accounting_failure) are contained in the [example](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/tree/master/PyLUCCBA/examples) folder.

#### Used data

  The results are based on data located in the body of [core.py](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/blob/master/PyLUCCBA/core.py) itself (under the form of python-native dictionary) and in the [resources](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/tree/master/PyLUCCBA/resources) folder. The latter folder is composed of:
  
•	The [dluc](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/tree/master/PyLUCCBA/resources/dluc) folder in which the dluc calculations are reported (see calculations in the provided “Data” Excel file). The .txt file indicates the units of data.

•	The [prices](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/tree/master/PyLUCCBA/resources/prices) folder which includes the carbon price trajectories scenarios. When only one-time prices are provided, such as in the World Energy Outlook, there is an automatic process which extrapolates the values for each year in an exponential way. For example, if prices are provided at year 2020 and 2025, then the prices at 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 are generated in an exponential way. The .txt file provides the unit and year base for the monetary used in scenarios (e.g. EUR 2012).

•	The [yields](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/tree/master/PyLUCCBA/resources/yields) folder which has two folders. The first, named [Input](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/tree/master/PyLUCCBA/resources/yields/Input), contains the yields necessary to the calculations: how much biofuel is produced from one tonne of feedstock (miscanthus or wheat) and how much biofuel can be produced per hectare. The second folder, named [Output](https://github.com/lfaucheux/PyLUCCBA/tree/master/PyLUCCBA/resources/yields/Output), is only instrumental and tautologically states than one tonne of biofuel is produced per tonne of output.

#### Generated results

  The generated results consists of three .xlsx files, namely [\_quantities.xlsx], [\_values.xlsx]  and [\_NPVs.xlsx] all three located in a folder that is named (by default) according to the arguments involved in the computation:
  
•	[\_quantities.xlsx], which only displays the quantities associated to each flow, among which, emissions from the process of production, emissions from the cultivation of the feedstock, land use change impact from soil, land use change impact from biomass, etc.

•	[\_values.xlsx] which displays the monetary value of the different types of flows from both bioethanol and gasoline (“black”) depending of the carbon price scenario chosen in “study_case.py”.

•	[\_NPVs.xlsx] which displays the net present values for both the uniform and the differentiated annualizations for the different types of flow again. All titles specify what is calculated. Note that “ut” refers to bioethanol quantities in tonne and “um” refers to bioethanol quantities in megajoules (MJ).

Note that each column has a title that is very verbose -- so as to make things as explicit as possible -- regarding what is calculated. When the prefix **ut_** appears in the title it means that it is calculated for one unit tonne of biofuel. When the prefix **um_** appears in the title, it means that it is calculated for one unit megajoule of biofuel. When nothing is specified, it takes into account the total quantity of biofuel produced.
