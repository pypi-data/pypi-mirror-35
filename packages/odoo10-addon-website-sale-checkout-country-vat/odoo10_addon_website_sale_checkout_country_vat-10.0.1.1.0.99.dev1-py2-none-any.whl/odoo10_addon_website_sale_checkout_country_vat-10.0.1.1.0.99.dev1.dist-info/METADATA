=================================
Website Sale Checkout Country VAT
=================================

This module extends the functionality of website_sale module to autocomplete
VAT country code in checkout process.

Configuration
=============

The default country that will appear is the one of the current user, or the one
of the Public User assigned to the website, or the one of the company that owns
the website. Change it in the corresponding place to get a sane default.

If you want to have a sane default also in the country address, check the
`website_sale_default_country
<https://github.com/OCA/e-commerce/tree/10.0/website_sale_default_country>`_
module.

Usage
=====

When a customer makes a purchase and do the checkout process, the VAT country
code can be selected separated from the code itself. This is useful in 2 ways:

- User is implicitly forced to input (select) a country with its code.
- Error in the VAT now only can be raised by an incorrect vat, not the absence
  of the country code, which usually confuses users.

If you change the country for the address and the VAT is empty, the VAT country
changes automatically too.
