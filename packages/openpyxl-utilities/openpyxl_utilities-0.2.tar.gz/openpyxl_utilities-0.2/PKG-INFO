Description: # Openpyxl_utilities
        
        This project consists of a library with functionalities to work with the popular module openpyxl (mainly used to read and write xlsx and xls files from Python) more efficiently. It was kickstarted when I found out openpyxl package does not includes sorting fucntionalities to create xlsx files already sorted (the only option available was to set a sorting button to sort the rows inside Microsoft Excel, not creating the file already sorted).
