.. currentmodule:: compas_fab.robots

This package contains classes for robot modeling and they are used by the
simulation, planning and execution backends to exchange information.

Classes
--------

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: generated/
    :nosignatures:

    Configuration
    PathPlan
    Robot
    RobotSemantics
    UrdfImporter

Artists
-------

In **COMPAS**, the `artists` are classes that assist with the visualization of
datastructures and models, in a way that maintains the data separated from the
specific CAD interfaces, while providing a way to leverage native performance
of the CAD environment.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: generated/
    :nosignatures:

    BaseRobotArtist

Unit conversion
---------------

The unit systems most commonly used in **compas_fab** are **meters** and **radians**.
The following functions help with converting units from one system to the other.
