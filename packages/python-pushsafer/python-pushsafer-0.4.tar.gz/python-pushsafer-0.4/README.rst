Overview
--------

After being imported, the module must be initialized by calling the ``init``
function with a valid private key. Thus, a typical use of the
``pushsafer`` module looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from pushsafer import init, Client

    init("<privatekey>")
    Client("").send_message("Message", "Hello", "323", "1", "4", "2", "https://www.pushsafer.com", "Open Pushsafer", "0", "2", "60", "600", "1", "", "", "")

You can also pass the ``privatekey`` optional argument to ``Client`` to
initialize the module at the same time:

.. code-block:: python

    from pushsafer import Client

    client = Client("", privatekey="<privatekey>")
    client.send_message("Message", "Hello", "323", "1", "4", "2", "https://www.pushsafer.com", "Open Pushsafer", "0", "1", "120", "1200", "0", "", "", "")

Params
------
client.send_message("Message", "Title", "Device or Device Group ID", "Icon", "Sound", "Vibration", "URL", "URL Title", "Time2Live", "Priority", "Retry", "Expire", "Answer", "Image 1", "Image 2", "Image 3")
