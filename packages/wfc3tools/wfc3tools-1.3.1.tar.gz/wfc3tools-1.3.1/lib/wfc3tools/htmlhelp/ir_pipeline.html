<h2>Estimate the signal in the zero read (ZSIGCORR)<a class="headerlink" href="#estimate-the-signal-in-the-zero-read-zsigcorr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This step measures the signal between the super zero read in the linearity reference file (NLINFILE) and the science zero read exposure, the steps are roughly as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>copy the zero sig image from the linearity reference file</li>
<li>compute any subarray offsets</li>
<li>subtract the super zero read reference image from the zero read science image</li>
<li>compute the noise in the zero image</li>
<li>pixels which contain more than ZTHRESH*noise of detected signal are flagged and that signal is passed to the NLINCORR step to help judge saturation and linearity, avoiding reference pixels.</li>
<li>low signal pixels are masked out by setting them to zero</li>
<li>the NLINCOR file has an extension with saturation values for each pixel which is referenced here. Pixels which are saturated in the zeroth or first reads are flagged in the DQ and the number of found saturated pixels are reported.</li>
<li>This step works poorly for bright targets which are already begining to saturate in the zeroth and first reads</li>
<li>This step acutally subtractes the super zero read from the science zero read instead of calculating an estimated signal based on the first read and zero read + estimated exposure time between them so that the difference in readout time for subarrays is not an issue.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="bias-correction-blevcorr">
<h2>Bias Correction (BLEVCORR)<a class="headerlink" href="#bias-correction-blevcorr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This step subtracts the bias level using the reference pixels around the perimeter of the detector, the boundries fo the reference pixels are defined in the OSCNTAB reference file. There are 5 reference pixels on each end of each row, but 1 is ignored on each side, for a total of 8 being used per row. The resistent mean of the standard deviation of all the reference pixels in the image is subtracted from the entire image and the value is stored in the MEANBLEV keyword in the output image header. The reference pixels are left in place in the IMA output image through processeing, but the final FLT image has been trimmed to just the science pixels.</p>

<div class="section" id="zero-read-subtraction-zoffcorr">
<h2>Zero read subtraction (ZOFFCORR)<a class="headerlink" href="#zero-read-subtraction-zoffcorr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The original zero read is subtracted from all groups in the science image, including the zeroth read itself, combining the DQ arrays with a logical OR. The ERR and SAMP arrays are unchanged and the TIME arrays are subtracted from each other. The exposure time for the group being corrected is reduced by an amount equal to the exposure time of the zero-read. At this point we&#8217;ve subtracted the mean bias using the reference pixels (BLEVCORR) and added back in the signal from the super zero read (done at the end of ZSIGCORR). What&#8217;s left in the zero read of the science image is the superbias subtracted signal. The TIME and SAMP arrays are saved to the FLT image only AFTER the CRCORR step has been completed.</p>

<h2>Error array initialization<a class="headerlink" href="#error-array-initialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The errors associated with the raw data are estimated according  to the noise model for the detector which currently includes a simple combination of detector readnoise and poisson noise from the pixel. Readnoise and gain are read from the CCDTAB reference file. The ERR array continues to be summed in quadrature as the SCI array is processed. Inside the final FLT image, the ERR array is calculated by CRCORR as the calculated uncertainty of the count-rate fit to the multiaccum samples.</p>

<h2>Detector Non-linearity Correction (NLINCORR)<a class="headerlink" href="#detector-non-linearity-correction-nlincorr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The integrated counts in the science images are corrected for the  non-linear response of the detectors, flagging pixels which extend into saturation (as defined in the saturation extension of the NLINFILE reference image. The observed response of the detector can be represented by two regimes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>At low and intermediate signal levels the detector response deviates from the incident flux in a way that is correctable using the following expression</li>
</ul>
<div class="math">
\[F_{c} = (1 + c_{1} + c_{2} \times F + c_{3}\times F^{2} + c_{4} \times F^{3}) \times F\]</div>
<p>where c1, c2, c3, and c4 are the correction coefficients, F is the uncorrected flux in DN and <span class="math">\(F_{c}\)</span> is the corrected flux. The current form of the correction uses a third-order polynomial, but the algoritm can handle an arbitrary number of coefficients. The number of coefficients and error terms are given by the values of the NCOEFF and NERR keywords in the header of the NLINFILE.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>At high signal levels, as saturation sets in, the response becomes highly non-linear and is not correctable to a scientifically useful degree.</li>
</ul>
<p>The signal in the zero read is temporarily added back to the zeroth read image of the science data before the linearity correction is applied and before the saturation is judged. Once the correction has been applied the signal is once again removed. This only occurs if the ZSIGCORR step is set to PERFORM. Saturation values for each pixel are stored in the NODE extension of the NLINFILE. After each group is corrected, the routine also sets saturation flags in the next group for those pixels that are flagged as saturated in the current group. This is necessary because the SCI image value of saturated pixels will sometimes start to go back down in the subsequent reads after saturation occurs, which means they could go unflagged by normal checking techniques. The SAMP and TIME arrays are not modified during this step.</p>

<h2>Dark Current Subtraction (DARKCORR)<a class="headerlink" href="#dark-current-subtraction-darkcorr" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The reference file listed under the DARKFILE header keyword is used to subtract the dark current from each sample. Due to potential non-linearities in some of the signal components, such as reet-related effecets in the first one or two reads of an exposure, the dark current subtraction is not aplied by simply scaling a generic reference dark image to the exposure time and then subtracting it. Instead, a library of dark current images is maintained that includes darks taken in each of the available predefined multiaccum sample sequences, as well as the available sub-array readout modes. The multiaccum dark reference file is subtracted read-by-read from the stack of science image readouts so that there is an exact match in the timings and other characteristics of the dark image and the science image. The subtraction does not include the reference pixel. The ERR and DQ arrays from the reference dark file are combined with the SCI and DQ arrays from the science image, but the SAMP and TIME arrays are unchanged. The mean of the dark image is saved to the MEANDARK keyword in the output science image header.</p>

The mean gain from all the amps is used to convert to the image to units of electrons. Errors and DQ flags from the flatfields are combined with the science data errors and flag, the TIME and SAMP arrays are unchanged.</p>

<h2>Calculation of image statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#calculation-of-image-statistics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The min, mean, maxmin and max SNR (for the SCI and ERR) for data values flagged as &#8220;good&#8221; in the DQ array (i.e. zero) are calculated and stored in the output SCI image header, the reference pixels are not used. This is performed for all samples in the IMA file as well as the FLT image but the input data is not modified in any way. Updated keywords in the science header include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>NGOODPIX</li>
<li>GOODMEAN</li>
<li>GOODMIN</li>
<li>GOODMAX</li>
<li>SNRMEAN</li>
<li>SNRMIN</li>
<li>SNRMAX</li>

<p>Reject cosmic rays from multiple images. CR-SPLIT and REPEAT-OBS exposures get combined, other members of the association file must be combined with Astrodrizzle  (see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST_overview/drizzlepac/">Astrodrizzle</a> ), which will also correct for geometric distortion. This step is also referred to as <a class="reference internal" href="wf3rej.html#wf3rej"><span>wf3rej</span></a>. The task uses the same statistical detection algorithm developed for ACS (acsrej), STIC (ocrrj) and WFPC2(crrej), providing a well-tested and robust procedure.</p>
