"""wsgimagic is designed to allow you to effortlessly transition any WSGI compliant Python application
(eg Flask, Django) to a completely serverless architecture using an AWS APIGateway Lambda Proxy pointing to a Lambda
function running your code. By simply using the wsgi_magic decorator, you can pass the incoming request off to your
application and ensure that the values are returned in the required format.
