# BUILDING
To upload package to PyPI:
- put `.pypirc` file in your homeÂ folder with the following content:

```cfg
 [distutils]
 index-servers=pypi

 [pypi]
 repository=https://pypi.python.org/pypi
 username=your_username # 'wall-e' for AppCraft account
 password=your_password
```

- run `chmod 600 ~/.pypirc`
- upload the package to PyPI by running `python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi`

If you don't want to create `.pypirc` file, you can use [TWINE](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine).
