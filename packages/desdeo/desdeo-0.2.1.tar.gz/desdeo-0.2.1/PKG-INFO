        DESDEO is a free and open source Python-based framework for developing and
        experimenting with interactive multiobjective optimization.

        ## Try in your browser ##
        
        You can try a guided example problem in your browser: [choose how to deal with
        river pollution using
        NIMBUS](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/industrial-optimization-group/desdeo-vis/master?filepath=desdeo_notebooks%2Fnimbus-river-pollution.ipynb).
        You can also [browse the other
        examples](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/industrial-optimization-group/desdeo-vis/master?filepath=desdeo_notebooks).
        
        ## What is interactive multiobjective optimization? ##
        
        There exist many methods to solve [multiobjective
        optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization)
        problems. Methods which introduce some preference information into the solution
        process are commonly known as multiple criteria decision making methods. When
        using so called [interactive
        methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization#Interactive_methods),
        the decision maker (DM) takes an active part in an iterative solution process
        by expressing preference information at several iterations. According to the
        given preferences, the solution process is updated at each iteration and one or
        several new solutions are generated. This iterative process continues until the
        DM is sufficiently satisfied with one of the solutions found.
        
        Many interactive methods have been proposed and they differ from each other
        e.g. in the way preferences are expressed and how the preferences are utilized
        when new solutions. The aim of the DESDEO is to implement aspects common for
        different interactive methods, as well as provide framework for developing and
        implementing new methods.
        
        ## Installation ##
        
        ### From conda-forge using Conda ###
        
        This is the **recommended installation method**, especially for those who are
        newer to Python. First download and install the [Anaconda Python
        distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
        
        Next, run the following commands in a terminal:
        
            conda config --add channels conda-forge
            conda install desdeo desdeo-vis
        
        Note: if you prefer not to install the full Anaconda distribution, you can
        install [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) instead.
        
        ### From PyPI using pip ###
        
        Assuming you have Pip and Python 3 installed, you can [install desdeo from
        PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/desdeo/) by running the following command in
        a terminal:
        
            pip install desdeo[vis]
        
        This installs desdeo *and*
        [desdeo-vis](https://github.com/industrial-optimization-group/desdeo-vis),
        which you will also want in most cases.
        
        ## Getting started with example problems ##
        
        To proceed with this section, you must [first install Jupyter
        notebook](http://jupyter.org/install). If you're using Anaconda, you already
        have it!
        
        You can copy the example notebooks to the current directory by running:
        
            python -m desdeo_notebooks
        
        You can then open them using Jupyter notebook by running:
        
            jupyter notebook
        
        After trying out the examples, the next step is to [read the full
        documentation.](https://desdeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
        
        ## Development ##
        
        ### Set-up ###
        
        You should install the git pre-commit hook so that code formatting is kept consistent automatically. This is configured using the pre-commit utility. See [the installation instructions](https://pre-commit.com/#install).
        
        If you are using pipenv for development, you can install desdeo and its
        dependencies after obtaining a git checkout like so:
        
            pipenv install -e .[docs,dev,vis]
        
        ### Tests ###
        
        Tests use pytest. After installing pytest you can run:
        
            pytest tests
        
        ### Release process ###
        
        1. Make a release commit in which the version is incremented in setup.py and an entry added to HISTORY.md
        
        2. Make a git tag of this commit with `git tag v$VERSION`
        
        3. Push -- including the tags with `git push --tags`
        
        4. Upload to PyPI with `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` and `twine upload dist/*`
