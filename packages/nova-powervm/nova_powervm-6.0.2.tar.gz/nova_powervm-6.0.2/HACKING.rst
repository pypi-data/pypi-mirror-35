Nova-PowerVM Specific Commandments
----------------------------------
- Follow the Nova HACKING.rst

- [P301] LOG.warn() is not allowed. Use LOG.warning()
- [P302] Deprecated library function os.popen()


Creating Unit Tests
-------------------
For every new feature, unit tests should be created that both test and
(implicitly) document the usage of said feature. If submitting a patch for a
bug that had no unit test, a new passing unit test should be added. If a
submitted bug fix does have a unit test, be sure to add a new one that fails
without the patch and passes with the patch.

For more information on creating unit tests and utilizing the testing
infrastructure in OpenStack Nova, please read ``nova/tests/README.rst``.
