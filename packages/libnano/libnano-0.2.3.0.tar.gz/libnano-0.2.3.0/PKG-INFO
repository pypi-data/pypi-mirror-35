        nucleic acid toolkit
        
        | Low level Python modules for working with DNA sequences
        | It was developed to be used as a cog in application specific libraries while avoiding bloat.<br/>
        | The goal is to be fast so most many things are written in Cython or C.
        | This project is under active development, and hopefully documentation will by done soon
        | Python 3.6+ only now as the code base is typed for Cython and type-hinted for Python code
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - **seqstr**: Reverse Complement and Hamming Distance finders
        - **seqgraph**: find cliques of compatible sequences
        - **seqint**: convert sequences less than 32 bases to binary
        - **seqscreen**: filter sequences based on things like GC content
        - **ensemblrest**: Use the Ensembl REST API to look up gene and transcript
          information
        - **prostr**: work with converting DNA to RNA to AA and back again
        - **barcode_tools**: generate DNA barcode sets with length and Hamming distance
          restrictions
        - **seqsearch**: search sequences for features like restriction sites or
          "submers" (kmers with 0 or more mismatches to a subsequence in the target)
        - **fileio**: genbank and fasta reader/writers, xmfa
        - **seqrecord**: less featured replacement for Biopython SeqRecord
