Dependencies and Credits
========================

Always pay credit where credit's due. ``symfit`` uses the following projects to make it's sexy interface possible:

- `leastsqbound-scipy <https://github.com/jjhelmus/leastsqbound-scipy>`_ is used to bound parameters to a given domain.
- `seaborn <http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/>`_ was used to make the beautifully styled plots in the example code. All you have to do to sexify your matplotlib plot's is import seaborn, even if you don't use it's special plotting facilities, so I highly recommend it.
- `numpy and scipy <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/>`_ are of course used to do efficient data processing.
- `sympy <http://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html>`_ is used for the manipulation of the symbolic expressions that give this project it's high readability.
