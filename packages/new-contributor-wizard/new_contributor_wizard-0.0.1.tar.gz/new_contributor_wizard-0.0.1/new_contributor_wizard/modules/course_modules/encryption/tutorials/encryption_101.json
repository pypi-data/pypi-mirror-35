Roughly speaking, encryption is the problem of how two parties can communicate in secret in the presence of an eavesdropper. The main goals of this chapter are to develop a meaningful and useful definition of what we are trying to achieve, and to take some first steps in actually achieving it. "

This tutorial begins the development of basic techniques to solve this problem. Besides transmitting a message over a network, these same techniques allow Alice to store a file on a disk so that no one else with access to the disk can read the file, but Alice herself can read the file at a later time."
