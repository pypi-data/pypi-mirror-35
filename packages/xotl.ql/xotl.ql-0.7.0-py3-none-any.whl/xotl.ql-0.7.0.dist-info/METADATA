A *pythonic* query language
===========================

This package provides an implementation of a query language for Python.
The query language is based on Python's generator expression. A query
in this language looks like this::

    >>> from xotl.ql import these, parent

    >>> query = these(child
    ...               for parent in this
    ...               if parent.children & parent.age > 32
    ...               for child in parent.children
    ...               if child.age < 6)

The resultant `query` is an object that "describes" at the syntactical
level the query expression above.

Full documentation kept at `Read the doc <http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.org/>`_.
