Algebra operator as abstractions
================================

To stress the idea of abstraction of algorithms, notice that engines may
proceed differently to obtain the result of |map f l|.

If we can sensibly split `l`:math: into `l_1, l_2, ..., l_n`:math: then:

  .. math::

     {\bf map}_f l = {\bf map}_f (l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus{} ... \oplus l_n) = \
     {\bf map}_f {\bf join}([l_1, l_2, ..., l_n]) = \
     {\bf join}([{\bf map}_f l_1, {\bf map}_f l_2, ..., {\bf map}_f l_n])


In fact, many times `l`:mathvar: is actually stored in chunks; it may be
stored distributed across several nodes or in a single node but split in
several size-bounded buckets.

Therefore, instead of getting all the pieces of `l`:mathvar: and then
performing the map over the entire collection, we can perform the map over the
pieces and then join them to get the result.  The engine can make any choice
it thinks it's the best.

.. |map f l| replace:: `{\bf map}_f l`:math:

Internal representation
=======================

.. autoclass:: Empty()

.. class:: Cons(x, xs)

   This is an *abstract* representation of the "|x:xs|" operation as referred
   in [QLFunc]_.  It's not meant to be efficient or to be used as true
   collection for Python programs.  It will recursively build all 'Cons' when
   instantiated so it may hit the maximum recursion depth very soon.

   The `xs` must be a *collection* or another `Cons` object.  If a collection
   is passed it will be converted to a `Cons` object.

   There's no built-in concept of *equality* or equivalence since that would
   require a specific type.  The proposition::

     Cons(1, Cons(2, Empty())) == Cons(2, Cons(1, Empty()))

   would be True for sets and bags but not for lists.

   Cons support the extraction of head and tail we see in functional
   languages:

     >>> from xotl.ql.translation._monads import Cons
     >>> head, tail = Cons(1, [2, 3])
     >>> head
     1

     >>> tail
     Cons(2, Cons(3, Empty()))

   Notice that unless you build the structure with `Cons` itself it may not be
   well defined the value of the head:

     >>> _, (head, tail) = Cons(1, {128, 90})   # Is head 128 or 90?

   There's no direct support for walking the `Cons` besides its ability to
   extract the head and tail.  Walking is easily defined by recursion or
   iteration:

     >>> def walk(c):
     ...    h, t = c
     ...    while t:
     ...       yield h
     ...       h, t = t
     ...    yield h

     >>> list(walk(Cons(1, [2, 3])))
     [1, 2, 3]

   Any of the arguments may take the value be `xoutil.Undefined`:obj: to
   "partialize" the constructor.  Using this feature you may declare the
   monadic Unit operator as:

     >>> from xoutil import Undefined
     >>> Unit = Cons(Undefined, [])

   And then use it like:

     >>> Unit(1)
     Cons(1, Empty())

   You can't walk a partial Cons:

     >>> head, tail = Unit                             # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     TypeError: Cons as a partial function cannot be iterated


.. autoclass:: Foldr(operator, initial, collection)

   `foldr` is defined by:

   .. math::
      :nowrap:

      \begin{eqnarray}
         {\bf foldr}^\tau & :: & (\alpha \rightarrow \beta \rightarrow \beta)
             \rightarrow \beta \rightarrow \tau\  \alpha \rightarrow \beta \\

             \\

         {\bf foldr}^\tau (\oplus) z []^\tau & = & z \\

         {\bf foldr}^\tau (\oplus)\ z\ (x :^\tau xs) & = & x \oplus
            ({\bf foldr}^\tau (\oplus)\ z\ xs)
      \end{eqnarray}


   The `foldr` operation is also known as the `reduce` function.  In fact
   ``Foldr(func, initial, coll)()`` returns the same result as
   ``reduce(func, coll.asiter(), initial)``:

       >>> import operator
       >>> from xotl.ql.translation._monads import Foldr
       >>> Foldr(operator.add, 0, Cons(1, [2]))()
       3

       >>> from functools import reduce
       >>> reduce(operator.add, Cons(1, [2]).asiter(), 0)
       3

   `Foldr`:class: instances have the following attributes:

   .. attribute:: operator

      The operator applied in each step of the computation.

   .. attribute:: arg

      The initial value `z`.

   .. attribute:: collection

      The collection of values.

   Any of the attributes can be `~xoutil.Undefined`:obj: to make the instance
   a partial definition.

   Calling a non-partial `Foldr`:class: instance traverses recursively the
   collection and applies the given operator.  If the collection is large
   enough this may hit the maximum recursion limit.

   Calling a partial `Foldr`:class: instance returns another `Foldr`:class:
   instance if not enough arguments were provided in order to render it
   non-partial.  If enough arguments are provided it behaves as if it were a
   non-partial.  This makes it easy to build 'functions' based on the first
   two arguments as in ``all = Foldr(operator.and, True)``.

   As noted in [QLFunc]_ the `Cons`:class: operator (|:|) needs to be further
   specified for *set* and *bags*.  Also the "|+|" infix operator needs to be
   commutative if |:| is left-commutative and idempotent if |:| is
   left-idempotent.

   For the purposes of `xotl.ql` this class is only meant for description and
   not functionality.  So these questions are not directly addressed.


.. autoclass:: Union(xs, ys)


Sorting
-------

Sorting is only sensibly defined over lists.  Our `Cons`:class: constructor
can be regarded as a list constructor.  The problem of sorting a list can be
defined with `Foldr`:class: as well.

We simply need to define the |x:<xs| operator that inserts `x` into `xs` in
the "right" position assuming `xs` is already sorted.

|x:<xs| is easily defined as:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{eqnarray}
      :^\tau_< \quad & :: & \alpha \rightarrow \tau\alpha \rightarrow \tau\alpha \\
      \\
      x :^\tau_< [] & = & x :^\tau [] \\
      x :^\tau_< (y :^\tau ys)  & = & {\bf if}\, x < y\,\,
                                      {\bf then}\, x :^\tau (y :^\tau ys)\,\,
                                      {\bf else}\, y :^\tau (x :^\tau_< ys)
   \end{eqnarray}

.. equations above are like:

   `:<`               :: a -> [a] -> [a]

   x `:<` []          =  x : []
   x `:<` (y : ys)    =  if x < y then x : (y : ys) else y : (x `:<` ys)


Now sorting can be achieved by:

.. math::

   {\bf sort}^\tau_< = {\bf foldr} :^\tau_< []

.. sort = foldr `:<` []


Defining |:>| is just as easy, and then `{\bf sort}^\tau_>`:math: can be
defined as well.

Sorting is only well defined if `<`:math: (or `>`:math:) are also properly
defined.

Yet, sorting can be expensive and engines are allowed to take shortcuts.  For
instance, Google's MapReduce [MAPRED]_ always sort the result of a map by
`keys` (all values in Google's MapReduce are a pair of ``key, value``.)

Nevertheless, it can be useful to include sorting in our algebraic definition
so that ordering instruction can be explicitly represented.

Notice, however, Python generator expressions don't directly support
expressing ordering.  Other query languages like SQL do support them.


.. autoclass:: SortedCons(order)

   `SortedCons`:class: won't sort a list.  It will simply "push" its first
   argument until it matches the `order` function::

     >>> from xotl.ql.translation._monads import SortedCons, Empty
     >>> SortedCons('<')(49, Cons(30, Cons(50, Cons(10, [-1]))))
     Cons(30, Cons(49, Cons(50, Cons(10, Cons(-1, Empty())))))

   Using `Foldr` we obtain a sort function::

     >>> Foldr(SortedCons('<'), Empty())(Cons(30, Cons(49, Cons(50, Cons(-1, Empty())))))
     Cons(-1, Cons(30, Cons(49, Cons(50, Empty()))))

     >>> Foldr(SortedCons('>'), Empty())(Cons(30, Cons(49, Cons(50, Cons(-1, Empty())))))
     Cons(50, Cons(49, Cons(30, Cons(-1, Empty()))))


.. |+| replace:: `\oplus`:math:
.. |:| replace:: `:^\tau`:math:
.. |x:xs| replace:: `x :^\tau xs`:math:

.. |x:<xs| replace:: `x :^{\tau}_{\small <} xs`:math:
.. |:<| replace:: `:^{\tau}_{\small <}`:math:
.. |:>| replace:: `:^\tau_>`:math:


Large collections
=================

Although this module is not meant for execution of these operations, and thus
truly large collections are out the question, we have a `LazyCons`:class:
class that allows to represent large collections.  However, the current
definition of `Foldr`:class: makes it unpractical to really work with them.

.. autoclass:: LazyCons(x, xs)


Provided functions
==================

.. function:: Map(f)

   Returns a map of `f`.  The result is another function that iterates over a
   collection `xs` applying `f` to each term.  It's defined as::

     Map = lambda f: Foldr(_Mapper(f), Empty())

   ``_Mapper`` is just a wrapper around `f`.

.. function:: Join(xs, ys)

   Joins `xs` and `ys` together.  Defined as::

     Join = Foldr(Union, Empty())

.. function:: Unit(x)

   Returns the collection containing `x`.  It's like ``[x]``.  Defined as::

     Unit = Cons(Undefined, Empty())

.. function:: Zero()

   An alias for `Empty`:class:



Memento for mathematical terms
==============================

.. glossary::

   monoid

      An algebraic structure with an *associative* operator `++` having a
      distinguished element *zero* (`0`) as left and right identity::

        0 ++ x = x
        x ++ 0 = x

      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid

      I don't know why in [MCQL]_ they claim `([], :)` is a monoid.  The
      structure of all `lists` with the `concatenation` operator (`++`) is a
      monoid.  Since all lists and the operator `++` are fully defined using
      `[]` and `:`, it's plausible to believe they refer to the monoid
      generated by those constructors.
