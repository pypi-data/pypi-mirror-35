=========================
The ``lino-cosi`` package
=========================





**Lino Così** is a free web application to make accounting simple.  It
is targeted to small and expanding enterprises or organisations who
want more than an off-the-shelf product.  With Lino Così you will
finally **perceive it as a joy** to

- manage your contacts, your catalog of products and your account
  chart
- record and print your sales invoices
- record your purchase invoices
- declare your VAT statement
- record your bank statements
- get your financial situation

Lino Così is **almost ready for use**.  Despite the fact that Lino
Così itself keeps things simple, its codebase is **used by more
sophisticated applications** like `Lino Welfare
<http://welfare.lino-framework.org>`__ or `Lino Voga
<http://voga.lino-framework.org>`__.
