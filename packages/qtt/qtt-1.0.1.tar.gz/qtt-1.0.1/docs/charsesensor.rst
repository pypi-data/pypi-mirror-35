Tips for tuning
---------------

* Is the bias current turned off?
* Have you depleted the 2deg enough?
* Optimize the peak by changing the detuning and the barrier to the reservoir
* If there interference from multiple RF signals?
* Try selecting a different peak of the SD
* Try recalibration of the RF frequency
