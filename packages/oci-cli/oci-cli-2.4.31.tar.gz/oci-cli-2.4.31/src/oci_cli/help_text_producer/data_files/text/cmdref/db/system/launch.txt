launch
******


Description
===========

Launches a new DB System in the specified compartment and Availability
Domain. You'll specify a single Oracle Database Edition that applies
to all the databases on that DB System. The selected edition cannot be
changed.

An initial database is created on the DB System based on the request
parameters you provide and some default options. For more information,
see Default Options for the Initial Database.

The DB System will include a command line interface (CLI) that you can
use to create additional databases and manage existing databases. For
more information, see the Oracle Database CLI Reference.


Usage
=====

   oci db system launch [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--availability-domain [text]
----------------------------

The Availability Domain where the DB System is located. [required]


--compartment-id, -c [text]
---------------------------

The Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) of the compartment the DB System  belongs
in. [required]


--cpu-core-count [integer]
--------------------------

The number of CPU cores to enable. The valid values depend on the
specified shape:

* BM.DenseIO1.36 and BM.HighIO1.36 - Specify a multiple of 2, from 2
  to 36. - BM.RACLocalStorage1.72 - Specify a multiple of 4, from 4 to
  72. - Exadata.Quarter1.84 - Specify a multiple of 2, from 22 to 84.
  - Exadata.Half1.168 - Specify a multiple of 4, from 44 to 168. -
  Exadata.Full1.336 - Specify a multiple of 8, from 88 to 336.

For VM DB systems, the core count is inferred from the specific VM
shape chosen, so this parameter is not used. [required]


--hostname [text]
-----------------

The host name for the DB System. The host name must begin with an
alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of 30 alphanumeric
characters, including hyphens (-).

The maximum length of the combined hostname and domain is 63
characters.

**Note:** The hostname must be unique within the subnet. If it is not
unique, the DB System will fail to provision. [required]


--shape [text]
--------------

The shape of the DB System. The shape determines resources allocated
to the DB System - CPU cores and memory for VM shapes; CPU cores,
memory and storage for non-VM (or bare metal) shapes. To get a list of
shapes, use the ListDbSystemShapes operation. [required]


--subnet-id [text]
------------------

The OCID of the subnet the DB System is associated with.

**Subnet Restrictions:** - For single node and 2-node (RAC) DB
Systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28 - For
Exadata and VM-based RAC DB Systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps
with 192.168.128.0/20

These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect
on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause
the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to
both the client subnet and backup subnet. [required]


--database-edition [STANDARD_EDITION|ENTERPRISE_EDITION|ENTERPRISE_EDITION_EXTREME_PERFORMANCE|ENTERPRISE_EDITION_HIGH_PERFORMANCE]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Oracle Database Edition that applies to all the databases on the
DB System. Exadata DB Systems and 2-node RAC DB Systems require
ENTERPRISE_EDITION_EXTREME_PERFORMANCE. [required]


--backup-subnet-id [text]
-------------------------

The OCID of the backup network subnet the DB System is associated
with. Applicable only to Exadata.

**Subnet Restrictions:** See above subnetId's **Subnet Restriction**.


--cluster-name [text]
---------------------

Cluster name for Exadata and 2-node RAC DB Systems. The cluster name
must begin with an an alphabetic character, and may contain hyphens
(-). Underscores (_) are not permitted. The cluster name can be no
longer than 11 characters and is not case sensitive.


--data-storage-percentage [integer]
-----------------------------------

The percentage assigned to DATA storage (user data and database
files). The remaining percentage is assigned to RECO storage (database
redo logs, archive logs, and recovery manager backups). Specify 80 or
40. The default is 80 percent assigned to DATA storage. This is not
applicable for VM based DB systems.


--defined-tags [complex type]
-----------------------------

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example: *{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}* This is a complex type
whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string
on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The --generate-param-json-input option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.


--display-name [text]
---------------------

The user-friendly name for the DB System. It does not have to be
unique.


--domain [text]
---------------

A domain name used for the DB System. If the Oracle-provided Internet
and VCN Resolver is enabled for the specified subnet, the domain name
for the subnet is used (don't provide one). Otherwise, provide a valid
DNS domain name. Hyphens (-) are not permitted.


--freeform-tags [complex type]
------------------------------

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example: *{"Department": "Finance"}* This is a complex type whose
value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the
command line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file
syntax.

The --generate-param-json-input option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.


--initial-data-storage-size-in-gb [integer]
-------------------------------------------

Size, in GBs, of the initial data volume that will be created and
attached to VM-shape based DB system. This storage can later be scaled
up if needed. Note that the total storage size attached will be more
than what is requested, to account for REDO/RECO space and software
volume.


--node-count [integer]
----------------------

Number of nodes to launch for a VM-shape based RAC DB system.


--disk-redundancy [HIGH|NORMAL]
-------------------------------

The type of redundancy configured for the DB System. Normal is 2-way
redundancy, recommended for test and development systems. High is
3-way redundancy, recommended for production systems.


--license-model [LICENSE_INCLUDED|BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE]
---------------------------------------------------------

The Oracle license model that applies to all the databases on the DB
System. The default is BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE.


--wait-for-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|UPDATING|TERMINATING|TERMINATED|FAILED]

defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state.

defined by --wait-for-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.


--wait-interval-seconds [integer]
---------------------------------

if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by --wait-for-state.
Defaults to 30 seconds.


--admin-password [text]
