.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Launches a new DB System in the specified compartment and Availability Domain. You\(aqll specify a single Oracle Database Edition that applies to all the databases on that DB System. The selected edition cannot be changed.
.sp
An initial database is created on the DB System based on the request parameters you provide and some default options. For more information, see \fI\%Default Options for the Initial Database\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Database/Tasks/launchingDB.htm#Default_Options_for_the_Initial_Database\fP>\&.
.sp
The DB System will include a command line interface (CLI) that you can use to create additional databases and manage existing databases. For more information, see the \fI\%Oracle Database CLI Reference\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Database/References/odacli.htm#Oracle_Database_CLI_Reference\fP>\&.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-availability\-domain [text]
.sp
The Availability Domain where the DB System is located. [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) of the compartment the DB System  belongs in. [required]
.SS \-\-cpu\-core\-count [integer]
.sp
The number of CPU cores to enable. The valid values depend on the specified shape:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
BM.DenseIO1.36 and BM.HighIO1.36 \- Specify a multiple of 2, from 2 to 36. \- BM.RACLocalStorage1.72 \- Specify a multiple of 4, from 4 to 72. \- Exadata.Quarter1.84 \- Specify a multiple of 2, from 22 to 84. \- Exadata.Half1.168 \- Specify a multiple of 4, from 44 to 168. \- Exadata.Full1.336 \- Specify a multiple of 8, from 88 to 336.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For VM DB systems, the core count is inferred from the specific VM shape chosen, so this parameter is not used. [required]
.SS \-\-hostname [text]
.sp
The host name for the DB System. The host name must begin with an alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of 30 alphanumeric characters, including hyphens (\-).
.sp
The maximum length of the combined hostname and domain is 63 characters.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP The hostname must be unique within the subnet. If it is not unique, the DB System will fail to provision. [required]
.SS \-\-shape [text]
.sp
The shape of the DB System. The shape determines resources allocated to the DB System \- CPU cores and memory for VM shapes; CPU cores, memory and storage for non\-VM (or bare metal) shapes. To get a list of shapes, use the \fI\%ListDbSystemShapes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/database/20160918/DbSystemShapeSummary/ListDbSystemShapes\fP> operation. [required]
.SS \-\-subnet\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the subnet the DB System is associated with.
.sp
\fBSubnet Restrictions:\fP \- For single node and 2\-node (RAC) DB Systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28 \- For Exadata and VM\-based RAC DB Systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20
.sp
These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and backup subnet. [required]
.SS \-\-database\-edition [STANDARD_EDITION|ENTERPRISE_EDITION|ENTERPRISE_EDITION_EXTREME_PERFORMANCE|ENTERPRISE_EDITION_HIGH_PERFORMANCE]
.sp
The Oracle Database Edition that applies to all the databases on the DB System. Exadata DB Systems and 2\-node RAC DB Systems require ENTERPRISE_EDITION_EXTREME_PERFORMANCE. [required]
.SS \-\-backup\-subnet\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the backup network subnet the DB System is associated with. Applicable only to Exadata.
.sp
\fBSubnet Restrictions:\fP See above subnetId\(aqs \fBSubnet Restriction\fP\&.
.SS \-\-cluster\-name [text]
.sp
Cluster name for Exadata and 2\-node RAC DB Systems. The cluster name must begin with an an alphabetic character, and may contain hyphens (\-). Underscores (_) are not permitted. The cluster name can be no longer than 11 characters and is not case sensitive.
.SS \-\-data\-storage\-percentage [integer]
.sp
The percentage assigned to DATA storage (user data and database files). The remaining percentage is assigned to RECO storage (database redo logs, archive logs, and recovery manager backups). Specify 80 or 40. The default is 80 percent assigned to DATA storage. This is not applicable for VM based DB systems.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
The user\-friendly name for the DB System. It does not have to be unique.
.SS \-\-domain [text]
.sp
A domain name used for the DB System. If the Oracle\-provided Internet and VCN Resolver is enabled for the specified subnet, the domain name for the subnet is used (don\(aqt provide one). Otherwise, provide a valid DNS domain name. Hyphens (\-) are not permitted.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-initial\-data\-storage\-size\-in\-gb [integer]
.sp
Size, in GBs, of the initial data volume that will be created and attached to VM\-shape based DB system. This storage can later be scaled up if needed. Note that the total storage size attached will be more than what is requested, to account for REDO/RECO space and software volume.
.SS \-\-node\-count [integer]
.sp
Number of nodes to launch for a VM\-shape based RAC DB system.
.SS \-\-disk\-redundancy [HIGH|NORMAL]
.sp

.SS \-\-license\-model [LICENSE_INCLUDED|BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE]
.sp
The Oracle license model that applies to all the databases on the DB System. The default is BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [PROVISIONING|AVAILABLE|UPDATING|TERMINATING|TERMINATED|FAILED]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp

.SS \-\-admin\-password [text]
.sp
A strong password for SYS, SYSTEM, and PDB Admin. The password must be at least nine characters and contain at least two uppercase, two lowercase, two numbers, and two special characters. The special characters must be _, #, or \-. [required]

.sp
The password to open the TDE wallet. [required]
