        This package provides Sendinblue_ integration for Plone.
        It allows you to link your Plone site to your Sendinblue account via a new configuration section.
        Then, you can add a portlet to allow visitors to subscribe to one of your list (you can choose which one).

        Features
        --------
        
        - multiple accounts / lists support : you can link more than one Sendinblue account to your site
        - archive link : you can provide an URL that points to archives (that you manage manually)
        - reCaptcha on subscription portlet to avoid spammers
        
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        Integration of Sendinblue account is limited to 50 lists (which is huge).
        This is linked to official API limitation (batched lists) but could be improved later.
        
        It has been developed on Plone 4.3. No other versions were tested.
