        ## What is it?
        
        **nashit** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive utilities
         which are widely used in day to day activities.using these functions are quite
        easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
        doing practical, **real world** tasks in Python. Additionally, it has
        the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source utility
         available in any language**. It is already well on
        its way toward this goal.
        
        ## Main Features
        Here are just a few of the things that nashit does well:
        
          - Downloading all files from a given URL of a specified format.
        
        As of now this package implements a single method **nas_fetch_it()** which can fetch all the mp3/pdf or (any other file format) from a perticular url.
        this method takes 3 parameters namely:
          - url : The URL from which data has to be fetched
          - save_path : where the data is to be saved
          - file_type : the file type which has to be searched(mp3 , pdf , xlsx etc...)
        
        ## Basic Usage
        
        ```sh
        from nashit import data_fetchers
        data_fetchers.nas_fetch_it("url","/path/to/save",".mp3")
        ```
        
        ## Where to get it
        The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:
        https://github.com/nashit93/nashit
        
        Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python
        package index](https://pypi.org/project/nashit) and on conda.
        
        ```sh
        # conda
        conda install nashit
        ```
        
        ```sh
        # or PyPI
        pip install nashit
        ```
        
        ## Dependencies
        - [os](https://github.com/python/cpython): 1.9.0 or higher
        - [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm): 2.5.0 or higher
        - [re](https://github.com/python/cpython): 2011k or higher

        ## Installation from sources
        To install nashit from source you need Cython in addition to the normal
        dependencies above. Cython can be installed from pypi:
        
        ```sh
        pip install cython
        ```
        
        In the `nashit` directory (same one where you found this file after
        cloning the git repo), execute:
        
        ```sh
        python setup.py install
        ```
