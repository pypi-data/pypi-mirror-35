Summary: A cross-platform collection of simple game environments suitable for Reinforcement Learning 
                   applications. The environments are all written in C++. A minimal interface exposes the relevant methods
                   to Python. This project is inspired by OpenAI Gym and even contains some of the environments that 
                   are also found in OpenAI Gym.
