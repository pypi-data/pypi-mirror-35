2018-09-20 geotecha-0.2.2 Release.
	       Changed link to docs from pythonhosted.org (deprecated)
		   to https://rtrwalker.github.io .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2018-09-19 geotecha-0.2.1 Release.
		   Added specbeam (see changelog below).
		   Updated for python3.6		   
2018-09-19 Abandoned trying to build and test code on anything less
           than python3.6 on 64 bit Windows.  There is an Anaconda
		   release for python3.6 and I can get it to build and pass
		   all tests on that.  Code may still work on earlier 
		   python versions and 32 bit systems, but Rohan has 
		   given up on them.
2018-08-19 Fixed issue with docs\sphinxext\gen_examples_rst_files.py .
		   When auto-generating rst files for the geotecha examples
		   in the docs, the old code (maybe with newer python??)
		   inserted paths with only a single backslash.  Fixed
		   using repr(path)[1:-1].
2018-08-17 Removed some more-than-one-"See Also" and more-than-one-
		   "Paramteters" sections in a docstring issues that were
		   causing newer versions of numpydoc to fail when building
		   docs.
2018-08-09 Added specbeam, code for Finite elastic Euler-Bernoulli beam
           resting on viscoelastic foundation with piecewise-linear
           properties, subjected to multiple moving point loads.  Used
           in journal article: Walker, R.T.R. and Indraratna, B, (in press)
           "Moving loads on a viscoelastic foundation with special
           reference to railway transition zones". International
           Journal of Geomechanics.
           Code and tests in:
           geotecha.beam_on_foundation.specbeam,
           geotecha.beam_on_foundation.test.test_specbeam
2018-08-04 Added SimpleTimer class to geotecha.inputputut.inputoutput for
           Simple nested wall clock timing, pritn to stdout.
2018-07-23 Converted a number of speccon in-place addition
           operations (+=) to np.add(A,B, out=A, casting='unsafe')
           as I was getting a heap of "TypeError: Cannot cast ufunc add
           output from dtype('complex128') to dtype('float64') with casting
           rule 'same_kind'" errors.  After specbeam modifications
           some things are expected to be complex, others
           aren't.  Probably not the best way to do things
           but this is where I am at.
2017-09-07 Guass Legendre and Gauss Kronrod numerical integration
           functions gl_quad and gk_quad now work with functions
           that return an array from scalar input.  The extra dimensions
           are tacked on the end of the return array.  See
           geotecha.mathematics.quadrature and
           geotecha.mathematics.test\test_quadrature.
2017-03-17 Generated new code for spectral Galerkin method integration.
           Integration is Eload_sinlinear for use with beams with moving
           loads. Generation code and result code incorporated into:
           geotecha.speccon.integrals_generate_code
           geotecha.speccon.integrals
           geotecha.speccon.ext_integrals
           geotecha.speccon.tests.test_integrals

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2016-05-31 geotecha-0.1.4 Release.
           Added YinAndGrahamSoilModel voidratio_stress relationship.
           Added Elasto-Plastic for Unsaturated Soils (EPUS) based on
           Pham (2005). beam_on_foundation sub-package including
           Ding et al (2012) "Finite elastic Euler-Bernoulli
           beam resting on non-linear viscoelastic foundation
           subjected to a moving load." . Some bug fixes.
           Fixed docs to have correct autosummary.
2016-05-31 Fixed py27 bug in
           geotecha.constitutive_models.void_ratio_stress.CcCrSoilModel.av_from_stress
           Previously Cx = chooser[np.sign(estress - pstress, dtype=int)]
           sometimes threw a type casting error.  Fixed by replacing with the
           following.
           Cx = chooser[np.array(np.sign(estress - pstress), dtype=int)]
2016-05-30 Fixed issue with YinAndGrahamSoilModel throwing error in
           geotecha.constitutive_models.void_ratio_stress when
           non-array inputs are used for t0, estress0, pstress0, e0.
           The fix does a number of 'if np.isscalar' checks so
           may slow down code.
2016-05-30 In docs\conf.  changed code "html_theme = 'default'" to
           "html_style = 'default.css'".  This is so new Sphinx version
           can find style sheet for doc building. Also added
           sphinx>=1.4 dependency to setup.py.
2016-05-30 Tidied up some docstrings in Ding et al 2102, epus etc.
2016-05-30 Added YinAndGrahamSoilModel soil model to
           geotecha.constitutive_models.void_ratio_stress
           Note: not fully tested.
2016-03-15 Added geotecha.beam_on_foundation.dingetal2012
           implementing Ding et al. 2012, '"Convergence of Galerkin
           truncation for dynamic response of finite beams on
           nonlinear foundations under a moving load."
           Journal of Sound and Vibration, 331(10), 2426-2442.
           Test routine provided.
2016-03-15 Added subpackage geotecha.beam_on_foundation.
           Beams on ealstic foundations, winkler foundations etc.
2016-03-15 Generated new code for spectral galerkin method integration.
           Integration is dim1sin_DD_abDDf_linear for use with beams.
           Generation code and result code incorporated into:
           geotecha.speccon.integrals_generate_code
           geotecha.speccon.integrals
           geotecha.speccon.ext_integrals
           geotecha.speccon.tests.test_integrals
2015-11-23 In geotecha.constitutive_models.epus.EpusProfile the profile now
           has a point just above and just below the water table.
           This is where rapid changes in unsaturated soil properties
           is likely to occur
2015-11-09 Added '--doctest-options=+IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL' to nose
           testing routines in
           tools\test_with_nose and tools\tests_with_nose_with_coverage
           and the description in README.rst.  Now when running
           geotecha tests the exception detail is ignored.  Previously
           there were some python version issues.
2015-11-09 In HansboNonDarcianFlowModel class in
           geotecha.constitutive_models.velocity_hydraulic_gradient
            it now uses geotecha.mathematics.rootfinding._fixed_point
            instead of error producing scipy.optimize.fixed_point.
2015-11-09 As at 20151106 scipy.optimize.fixed_point may not
           converge for all functions because it uses convergence
           acceleration.  I added a non-convergence acceleration
           version '_fixed_point' to geotecha.mathematics.rootfinding.
2015-10-21 In MarkersDashesColors class of
           geotecha.plotting.one_d, markers will now default to
           filled.
2015-06-23 Added geotecha.plotting.one_d.save_figure to easily save
           multiple versions of a matplotlib figure.
2015-06-18 Added constitutive_models.epus elasto-plastic unsaturated
           soil.  A python version of teh visual basic code in the
           appendix of Pham (2005) PhD thesis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-02-13 geotecha-0.1.3 Release. Now compatible with python-2.7 and
           python-3.4.  32 and 64-bit windows binaries available on
           pypi. Added many speccon examples. Updated
	         README.rst so that github and pipy have nice looking
           front pages. Expanded permissible numpy functions in
	         inputoutput syntax_checker.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-01-30 geotecha-0.1.2 Release.  Similar release to 0.1.1 but with
           with important changes to docs.  Added sphinx extensions
           gen_api_rst_files.py and gen_examples_rst_files.py which
           auto generate the api rst files and the example docs when
           I make the docs with 'make html'.  Now I gan just add
           example files and have them appear in the docs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2015-01-14 geotecha-0.1.1 Release.  This is the version that works on
           Rohan's computer based on pythonxy-2.7.6.1.  I anticipate
           some missing requirements in setup.py.  Also I have used
           'python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32' when building
           the extensions etc.  I think later versions of pythonxy
           do not have mingw so I'll adjust accordingly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2013-05-01 Approximate start of geotecha project. Version 0.1.0.
