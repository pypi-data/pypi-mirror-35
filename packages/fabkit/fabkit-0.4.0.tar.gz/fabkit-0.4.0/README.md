# Fabkit
This library is a group of common helpers for [Fabric 1.x](https://github.com/fabric/fabric) 
used by myself in my projects.

It was inspired by similar [fabtools](https://github.com/fabtools/fabtools)
but it's targeting to be working on Arch Linux

## Installation

To install the latest release from PyPI

```bash
$ pip install fabkit
```

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* Arch Linux remote target (but most utils are generic and should work on other Linux systems)

## Examples

tbd.
