**Directory forms API client for headless forms.**

---

## Requirements

## Installation

```shell
pip install directory_forms_api_client
```

## Usage

The api client must be passed into each form instance, so first set the the client settings:

| Setting                         | Notes                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| DIRECTORY_FORMS_API_BASE_URL    |                                                             |
| DIRECTORY_FORMS_API_API_KEY     | Unique to client. Retrieved during the on-boarding process. |
| DIRECTORY_FORMS_API_SENDER_ID   | Unique to client. Retrieved during the on-boarding process. |
| DIRECTORY_FORMS_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT |                                                             |

Once that is done the forms can be used.


### Submit to Zendesk

```python
from directory_forms_api_client import forms


class ZendeskForm(forms.ZendeskAPIForm):
    # note that the base form provides `requester_email` email field
    title = fields.CharField()


form = ZendeskForm(data={
    'title': 'example',
    'requester_email': 'three@example.com'
})
assert form.is_valid()
form.save()
```

### Send as email

#### Send to a user-submitted email address

```python
from directory_forms_api_client import forms

class EmailForm(forms.ZendeskAPIForm):
    title = fields.CharField()
    email = fields.EmailField()

form = TestForm(data={'title': 'Example', 'email': 'a@foo.com'})

assert form.is_valid()
form.save(submission_recipients=[form.cleaned_data['email']])

```

#### Send to a pre-defined email address
```python
from directory_forms_api_client import forms

class EmailForm(forms.EmailAPIForm):
    title = fields.CharField()

form = TestForm(data={'title': 'Example'})

assert form.is_valid()
form.save(submission_recipients=[settings.FEEDBACK_EMAIL_RECIPIENTS])

```
