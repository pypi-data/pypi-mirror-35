Description: # l298n Module
        This module is designed to be used with two GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.
        
        ## Usage
        First, create an instance of l298n using 2 pin numbers from the board as 
        attributes. Use the GPIO number as opposed to the board number.
        
        ```python
        from l298n import l298n
        motor = l298n(2, 3)
        ```
        
        Then, using methods from l298n, a motor can be activated in the desired direction.
        ```python
        motor.forwards()
        motor.backwards()
        motor.stop()
        ```
