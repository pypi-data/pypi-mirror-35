def thr_calculator(filtered_img,min_distance,stringency):

    """
    Function used to calculate the threshold to use for the dots
    counting in a 2D image. 

    Parameters:
    -----------

    filtered_img: np.array float64
        preprocessed image used to count the dots.
    min_distance: int
        minimum distance that two maxima need to have in order to be defined as 
        separete peaks.
    stringency: int
        integer used to select the stringency of the generated
        threshold. By adding stringency to the thr_idx we can select a Thr with higher
        value from the thr_array.

    Returns:
    -----------

    counting_dict : dict 
        dictionary containing all the counting infos:
        selected_thr: float64
            Thr used for counting after application of the stringency.
        calculated_thr: float64 
            Calculated Thr
        selected_peaks: int64 
            2D coords of the peaks defined using the selected_thr.
        thr_array: float64 
            Thr array of 100 points distributed between (Img.min(),Img.max()).
        peaks_coords: float64 
            list of all the 3D coords calculated using the Thr array.
        total_peaks: list of int 
            List of the peaks counts.
        thr_idx: int64 
            index of the calculated threshold.
        stringency: int64 
            stringency used for the identification of the selected_peaks
