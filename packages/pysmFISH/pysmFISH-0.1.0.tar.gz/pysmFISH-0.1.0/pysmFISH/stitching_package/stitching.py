    Find the pairwise pars for an unknown stitching.
    Works best with a folder containing

    Parameters:
    -----------

    folder: str
        String representing the path of the folder containing
        the tile file and the yaml metadata file. Needs a
        trailing slash ('/').
    tile_file: pointer
        HDF5 file handle. Reference to the opened file containing the tiles.
    hyb_nr: int
        The number of the hybridization we are going to
        stitch. This will be used to navigate tile_file and find
        the correct tiles.
    gene: str
        The name of the gene we are going to stitch.
        This will be used to navigate tile_file and find the
        correct tiles. (Default: 'Nuclei')
    pre_proc_level: str
        The name of the pre processing group of
        the tiles we are going to stitch.
        This will be used to navigate tile_file and find the
        correct tiles. (Default: 'Filtered')
    est_overlap: float
        The fraction of two neighbours that should
        overlap, this is used to estimate the shape of the
        tile set and then overwritten by the actual average
        overlap according to the microscope coordinates.
        (default: 0.1)
    y_flip: bool
        The y_flip variable is designed for the cases where the
        microscope sequence is inverted in the y-direction. When
        set to True the y-coordinates will also be inverted
        before determining the tile set. (Default: False)
    nr_dim: int
        If 3, the code will assume three dimensional data
        for the tile, where z is the first dimension and y and x
        the second and third. For any other value 2-dimensional data
        is assumed. (Default: 2)
    
    Returns:
    --------

    tiles: list
        List of references to the the tiles in the hdf5 file tile_file.
    contig_tuples: list
        List of tuples. Each tuple is a tile pair.
        Tuples contain two tile indexes denoting these
        tiles are contingent to each other.
    nr_pixels: int
        Height and length of the tile in pixels, tile is assumed to be square.
    z_count: int
        The number of layers in one tile (size of the z-axis). Is 1 when nr_dim is not 3.
    micData: object
        MicroscopeData object. Contains coordinates of the tile corners as taken from the microscope.

    Calculates a shift in global coordinates for each tile (global

        is assumed. (default: 2)
    save_alignment: bool
        When False only the stitching

    """Get the information necessary to do the pairwise allignment
    Modified version of the get_pairwise_input functions that work on .npy 
    files and not on hdf5

    Find the pairwise pairs for an unknown stitching.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    
    image_properties: dict 
        Dictionary with the image details parsed from the Experimental_metadata.yaml file
    converted_positions: dict
        Dictionary  with the coords of the images for all hybridization
        The coords are a list of floats
    hybridization: str 
        Hybridization that will be processed (Ex. Hybridization2)
    est_overlap: float
        The fraction of two neighbours that should
        overlap, this is used to estimate the shape of the
        tile set and then overwritten by the actual average
        overlap according to the microscope coordinates.
        (default: 0.1)
    y_flip: bool
        The y_flip variable is designed for the cases where the
        microscope sequence is inverted in the y-direction. When
        set to True the y-coordinates will also be inverted
        before determining the tile set. (Default: False)
    nr_dim: int
        If 3, the code will assume three dimensional data
        for the tile, where z is the first dimension and y and x
        the second and third. For any other value 2-dimensional data
        is assumed. (Default: 2)
    
    Returns:
    --------

    tiles: np.array
        Array of int with the tiles number. -1 indicate an empty tile
    contig_tuples: list
        List of tuples. Each tuple is a tile pair.
        Tuples contain two tile indexes denoting these
        tiles are contingent to each other.
    nr_pixels: int
        Height and length of the tile in pixels, tile is assumed to be square.
    z_count: int
        The number of layers in one tile (size of
        the z-axis). Is 1 when nr_dim is not 3.
    micData: object
        MicroscopeData object. Contains coordinates of
        the tile corners as taken from the microscope.
