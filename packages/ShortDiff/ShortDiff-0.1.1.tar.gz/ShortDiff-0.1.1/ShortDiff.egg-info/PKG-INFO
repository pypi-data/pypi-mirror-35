Description: # ShortDiff
        
        This is a Python implementation of a diff algorithm. It's purpose is to
        produce one way and as short as possible patch to go from a file to another.
        This is useful for keeping history of modifications of a text file without
        keeping a copy of each state (this is the easy part of version control).
        This produce shorter patch than any output from the GNU diff tool.
        By the way it is one way witch means the patch to go from A to B is not
        usable to go from B to A.
        
        # Disclaimer
        
        Since it is a pure python script and it is a O(N\*M) (where N and M are the
        number of line of each file) in time complexity it is not very performant.
        You should not use it in any serious project. As for me I wrote it for
        educational purpose and I use it in a really small scale project.
        
        Still for educational project there are more naive version in the archive
        directory. The final module is a refinment of these.
