Thonny is thankful to:

Its home
--------
Thonny was born in University of Tartu (https://www.ut.ee), Institute of Computer Science (https://www.cs.ut.ee) and the main development is being done here.

Supporters
----------
Development of several features in Thonny 3.0 was proposed and supported by Raspberry Pi Foundation (https://www.raspberrypi.org).

Python
------
It's a really nice language for teaching programming. It also has some nice technical properties, that made Thonny's program animation features pleasure to implement.

Libraries and resources

* jedi (http://jedi.readthedocs.io) is used for code completion, go to definition, etc.
* pylint (https://www.pylint.org/) is used as one of the engines behind warnings presented by the Assistant.
* mypy (http://mypy-lang.org/) is used, just like pylint, as a warning engine in the Assistant.
* certifi (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/certifi) provides SSL certs for bundled Python in Linux and Mac.
* distro (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distro) is optionally used for detecting Linux version in About dialog.
