RecordsKeeper-python-lib3 
=========================


It is an infrastructure to build RecordsKeeper blockchain-based applications, products and is used to work around applications that are built on top of this blockchain platform.

**Note:** If you're looking for the RecordsKeeper Python Library please see: [RecordsKeeper Python Library](https://github.com/RecordsKeeper/recordskeeper-python-sdk/tree/python-3.0)


## Getting Started

Before you begin you'll need to have python v3 installed. There are several options for installation for python depending on the operating system you are using.


```bash
pip install -g RecordsKeeperPython3Lib
```

Import these python libraries first to get started with the library classes and functions.


```bash
    import requests
    import json
    from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
    import yaml
    import sys
    import binascii
```


Creating Connection
-------------------

Entry point for accessing Address class resources.

Config file to import config parameters:

```bash
    
    with open("config.yaml", 'r') as ymlfile:
        cfg = yaml.load(ymlfile)
```
   
Importing chain url and chain name from config file:

* URL: Url to connect to the chain ([RPC Host]:[RPC Port])
* Chain-name: chain name

```bash

    url = network['url']
    chain = network['chain']

```   

Node Authentication
-------------------

Importing user name and password values from config file to authenticate the node:

* User name: The rpc user is used to call the APIs.
* Password: The rpc password is used to authenticate the APIs.

```bash
    
    user = network['rkuser']
    password = network['passwd']

```
