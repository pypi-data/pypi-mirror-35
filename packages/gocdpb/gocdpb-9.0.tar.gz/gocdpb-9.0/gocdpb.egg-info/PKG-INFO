Description: The Go CD Pipeline Builder is designed to have the same function in the GoCD eco system, as the Jenkins Job Builder has in the Jenkins eco system. Given a (git) repository and appropriate configuration, it should be able to add a suitable pipeline to a Go-server. The current version does not trigger on git events. It is simply a command line driven tool.
