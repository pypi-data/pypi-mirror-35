        Marko is a markdown parser written in pure Python that complies [CommonMark's spec v0.28][spec].
        It is designed to be highly extensible, see [Extend Marko](#extend-marko) for details.
        
        Marko requires Python 3.4 or higher, Python 2.7 support is still in plan but I guess it is not needed.
        
        ## Why Marko
        
        Among all implementations of Python's markdown parser, it is a common issue that user can't easily extend it to add his own features. Furthermore, [Python-Markdown][pymd] and [mistune][mistune] don't comply CommonMark's spec. It is a good reason for me to develop a new markdown parser and use it.
        
        Respecting that Marko complies CommonMark's spec at the same time, which is a super complicated spec, Marko's performance will be affected.
        A benchmark result shows that Marko is 3 times slower than [Python-Markdown][pymd], but a bit faster than [Commonmark-py][cmpy], much slower than [mistune][mistune]. If performance is a bigger concern to you than spec compliance, you's better choose another parser.

        ## Use Marko
        
        The installation is very simple:
        
            $ pip install marko
        
        And to use it:
        ```python
        from marko import Markdown
        markdown = Markdown()
        print(markdown(text))
        ```
        Marko also provides a simple CLI, for example, to render a document and output to a html file:
        
            $ cat my_article.md | marko > my_article.html
