## 2.6.0
- Fix incremental pagination by making an exception to status 422, removing the
  existing query `kwargs`, and looking for incremental and certain conditions
  to mark the end of `get_all_pages` (by Sarfaraz Soomro).
- API generator updates corresponding to the end of web portal and forums
  support, as well as the replacement of zopim with chat (by Craig Davis).
- Add `raw_query` parameter for explicitly setting and overriding the query
  string. The enables use cases where, for example, query parameters need to be
  repeated and therefore cannot go into a dictionary.
- Add `retval` parameter to allow for explicitly requesting a certain component
  of a response. Valid values are 'content', 'code', 'location', and 'headers'.
- Regenerate API from updated mirror. See [full
