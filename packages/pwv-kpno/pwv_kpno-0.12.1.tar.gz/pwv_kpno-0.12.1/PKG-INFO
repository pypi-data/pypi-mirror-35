Description: ## Overview
        
        
        
        **pwv_kpno** is a Python package for modeling the atmospheric absorption due
        to H<sub>2</sub>O at Kitt Peak National Observatory. It provides atmospheric
        models from 3,000 to 12,000 Angstroms for years 2010 onward. Understanding atmospheric
        effects is important when calibrating ground based astronomical observations.
        Traditionally, determining the detailed atmospheric transmission function at a
        given date and time required performing dedicated spectrographic observations.
        **pwv_kpno** provides an alternative that can be performed at the user's
        convenience.
        
        Atmospheric absorption in the near-infrared is highly dependent on the column
        density of precipitable water vapor (PWV). By measuring the delay of GPS
        signals through the atmosphere, the [SuomiNet](http://www.suominet.ucar.edu)
        project provides accurate PWV measurements for multiple, international
        locations. The **pwv_kpno** package uses published SuomiNet data in conjunction
        with MODTRAN models to determine the modeled atmospheric transmission function
        at Kitt Peak in close to real time. The package also provides automated
        retrieval and processing of SuomiNet data, allowing photometry to typically be
        corrected within an hour of observation.
        
        **pwv_kpno** is open source software released under the GNU General Public
        License. Issues, pull requests, and feedback are welcome.
