"""This contains instructions to auto rename directories.  First give a
search regex to identify a directory to rename, then give regex for the
groups to parse in the original name (make sure to match the whole name,
so backreferencing in Python will work properly) then give a new name
that uses the groups matched. See the function re.sub at
