.SH NAME
transfat \- transfer and sort audio files to/on a FAT device

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtransfat\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fISOURCES\fR] [\fIDESTINATION\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fItransfat\fR is a convenience program designed to make it painless to play music on certain car stereos; namely, car stereos that (1) only accept MP3 format and (2) do not alphanumerically play audio files within a directory. A few things are done when running this program: certain files are filtered out from the transfer list (e.g., CUEs, LOGs, etc), non-MP3 audio files are converted to MP3, the audio files are transferred to a device, the device is unmounted, and then the device is fatsorted.

Running without any \fISOURCES\fR simply doesn't do any transfering, so it's a good option if you only want to rename directories or sort your drive.
