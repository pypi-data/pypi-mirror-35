# LED Wall Python Library

A simple but powerful python library to manipulate WS2812b LED panel.
Panels cand be connected via USB cable or accessed via UDP. This library only supports Python 3 but is OS independent.

The library is intended to be used in conjunction with aa arduino or nodemcu tat controls a bunch of LEDs. Of course, you can write sketches to controll the LEDs directly in c using the arduino ide. But using python on a raspberry or some other computer will offer you more flexibility and speed in development. Also, you can leverage from wide range of existing python libraries. With just a few lines of code, you can integrate gamepads using the awesome inputs [library](https://pypi.org/project/inputs/).

For more information, examples, installation guides and the arduino/nodemcu sketches checkout my git [repository](https://github.com/FirstKlaas/LEDWall).

Also an [online dokumentation](http://make.nebuhr.de/ledwall/doc/) for the library is available.
