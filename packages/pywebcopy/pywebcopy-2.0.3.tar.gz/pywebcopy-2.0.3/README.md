- have a single-function basic usages
- lots of configuration for many custom needs
- many `utils` and `generator` functions to ease extraction of any part of website

## 1.1 Installation

`pywebcopy` is available on PyPi and is easily installable using `pip`

```Python
pip install pywebcopy
```

## 1.2 Basic Usages

### 1.2.1 Direct Function Methods
To mirror any single page, just type in python console

```Python
from pywebcopy.core import save_webpage


save_webpage(
    url='http://example-site.com/index.html',
    download_loc='path/to/downloads'
)
```

To mirror full website (This could overload the target server, So, be careful)

```Python
from pywebcopy.core import save_webpage


save_webpage(
    url='http://example-site.com/index.html',
    download_loc='path/to/downloads',
    copy_all=True
)
```

### 1.2.2 Object Creation Method

```Python
from pywebcopy.structures import WebPage

url = 'http://example-site.com/index.html'
download_loc = 'path/to/downloads/folder'

wp = WebPage(url, download_loc)

# if you want assets only
wp.save_assets_only()

# if you want html only
wp.save_html_only()

# if you want complete webpage
wp.save_complete()

# bonus : you can also use any beautiful_soup methods on it
links = wp.find_all('a', href=True)

```

that's it.

You will now have a folder at `download_loc` with all the webpage and its linked files ready to be used.

Just browse it as would on any browser!

## 1.3 Configuration

`pywebcopy` is highly configurable.

### 1.3.1 Direct Call Method

To change any configuration, just pass it to the `init` call.

Example:

```Python
from pywebcopy.core import save_webpage

save_webpage(

    url='http://some-site.com/', # required
    download_loc='path/to/downloads/', # required

    # config keys are case-insensitive
    any_config_key='new_value',
    another_config_key='another_new_value',

    ...

    # add many as you want :)
)
```

### 1.3.2 `config.setup_config` Method

>**This function is changed from  `core.setup_config`**

You can manually configure every configuration by using a 
`config.setup_config` call.

```Python

import pywebcopy

url = 'http://example-site.com/index.html'
download_loc = 'path/to/downloads/'

pywebcopy.config.setup_config(url, download_loc)

# done!

>>> pywebcopy.config.config['url']
'http://example-site.com/index.html'

>>> pywebcopy.config.config['mirrors_dir']
'path/to/downloads'

>>> pywebcopy.config.config['project_name']
'example-site.com'


## You can also change any of these by just adding param to
## `setup_config` call

>>> pywebcopy.config.setup_config(url, 
        download_loc,project_name='Your-Project', ...)

## You can also change any config even after
## the `setup_config` call

pywebcopy.config.config['url'] = 'http://url-changed.com'
# rest of config remains unchanged

```

Done!

### 1.3.3 List of available `configurations`

Thanks!

## 1.5 Undocumented Features

I built many utils and classes in this project to ease 
the tasks I was trying to do.

But,
these task are also suitable for general purpose use.

So,
if you want, you can help in generating suitable `documentation` for these undocumented ones, then you can always email me.

## 1.6 Changelog

### [version 2.0.0]

#### [changed]

- `core.setup_config` function is changed to `config.setup_config`.

#### [added]

- added `utils.trace` decorator, which  will **print** *function_name*, *args*, *kwargs* and *return value* when debug config key is True.
- new html-parsers ('html5lib', 'lxml') are supported for better webpages.
- html-parser is now defaulted to 'lxml'. You can use any through new `config.config` key called `parser`

#### [fixed]

- fixed issue while changing `user-agent` key cracked 
webpages. You can now use any browser's user-agent id and it will get exact same page downloaded.
- fixed issue in `generators.extract_css_urls` which was caused by `str` and `bytes` difference in python3.
- fixed issues while modules importing. (Thanks "**Илья Игоревич**").
- added `errorhandling` to required functions


### [version 2.0(beta)]

- `init` function is replaced with `save_webpage`
- three new `config` automation functions are added -
  - `core.setup_config` (creates every ideal config just from url and download location)
  - `config.reset_config` (resets the configuration to default state)
  - `config.update_config` (manual-mode version of `core.setup_config`)  
- object `structures.WebPage` added
- merged `generators.generate_style_map` and `generators.generate_relative_paths` to a single function `generators.generate_style_map`
- rewrite of majority of functions
- new module `exceptions` added


### [version 1.10]

- `url` is checked and resolved of any redirection before starting any work functions.
- `init` vars : `mirrors_dir` and `clean_up` were fixed which cleaned the dir before the log was completely written.
- `init` call now takes `url` arg by default and could raise a error when not supplied
- professional looking log entries
- rewritten archiving system now uses `zipfile` and `exceptions` handling to prevent errors and eventual archive corruption

### [version 1.9]

- more redundant code
- modules are now separated based on type e.g. Core, Generators, Utils etc.
- new helper functions and class `structures.WebPage`
