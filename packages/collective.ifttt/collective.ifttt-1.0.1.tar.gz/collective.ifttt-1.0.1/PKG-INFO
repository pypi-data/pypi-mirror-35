        collective.ifttt is a Plone addon which enables any Plone site to play in the IFTTT (pronounced /Éªft/) ecosystem by allowing you to create IFTTT applets at `ifttt.com <http://ifttt.com>`_.
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Below are a few examples of using IFTTT with Plone sites:
        
        - If a news item is published, then tweet about it or post it on Facebook.
        - If an event is published, then add it to my calendar.
        - If new users sign up for an event, then add them to a Slack channel.
        - If content changes, then record who edited it in a Google spreadsheet.
