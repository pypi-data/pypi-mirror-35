        ## Driver Methods 
        
        **TODO**
        
        ## Development
        
        A local instance of Rocket.Chat is required for unit tests to confirm 
        connection and subscription methods are functional. And it helps to manually 
        run your SDK interactions (i.e. bots) locally while in development.
        
        In this repository have a **docker-compose** file that will help you to up
        your own Rocket.Chat instance.
        
        ### Docker
        
        Run this commands to start Rocket.Chat and database in background mode:
        
        ```sh
        docker-compose up -d mongo
        
        docker-compose up -d rocketchat
        ```
        
        * After that access `localhost:3000`
        
        * Create the administrator user.
        
        * Add the bot user with the necessary settings see `easybot.py` to check
        the `user` and `password`.
