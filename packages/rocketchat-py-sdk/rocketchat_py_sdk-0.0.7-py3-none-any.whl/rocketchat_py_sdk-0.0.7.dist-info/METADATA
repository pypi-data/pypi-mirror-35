A local instance of Rocket.Chat is required for unit tests to confirm 
connection and subscription methods are functional. And it helps to manually 
run your SDK interactions (i.e. bots) locally while in development.

In this repository have a **docker-compose** file that will help you to up
your own Rocket.Chat instance.

### Docker

```sh
docker-compose up -d mongo

docker-compose up -d rocketchat
```

* After that access `localhost:3000`

* Create the administrator user.

* Add the bot user with the necessary settings see `easybot.py` to check
the `user` and `password`.
