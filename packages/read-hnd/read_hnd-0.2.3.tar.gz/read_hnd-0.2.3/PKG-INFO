Description: # Module read_hnd
        
        For interacting with HND file types
        
        To set it up, you just install it as any other module:
        
        `pip install --user read_hnd`
        
        This should fix any dependency issues and hopefully work without too much issue.
        
        ### Module use:
        To run the code there are a few options:
        
        Convert all the HND images in that folder and save then in a Processed subfolder
        
        `python -m read_hnd -f C:\path\to\folder`
        
        Read and display the image
        
        `python -m read_hnd -i C:\path\to\image.hnd -p=1`
        
        Save the image
        
        `python -m read_hnd -i C:\path\to\image.hnd -o C:\path\to\save.tiff`
        
        Also save the metadata
        
        `python -m read_hnd -i C:\path\to\image.hnd -o C:\path\to\save.tiff -m C:\path\to\meatadata.txt`
        
        ### Use in python code:
        ```python
        from read_hnd import read_hnd					# Load module
        fp = read_hnd.HndReader(inputfile)				# Create object to interact with file
        fp.headerData()									# Read the header
        fp.pixelData()									# Read pixel data (must read header first)
        matplotlib.plot.imshow(fp.uncompressedImage)	# Show the image using matplotlib
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        This is very much still a work in progress, so there may be bugs. For example, the metadata doesnâ€™t seem to read correctly (i.e., you get some non-sensical values)
