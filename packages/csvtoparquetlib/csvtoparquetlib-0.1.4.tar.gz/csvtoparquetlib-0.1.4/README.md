# Serverless using CSVtoParquet for IBM Cloud

This repository uses a version of the Python library csvtoparquet that's been modified from a command-line tool to a library you can place into your application and run.

The `Dockerfile` gives an example of how it's put together and the folder `serverless` contains the code for the serverless function that will list the CSV files in your IBM Cloud Object Storage bucket.
