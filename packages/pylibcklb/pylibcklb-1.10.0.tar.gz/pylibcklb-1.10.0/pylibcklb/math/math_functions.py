# @author	    Tobias Ecklebe
# @date		    05.11.2017
# @version	    0.1.0
# @note		    This file includes functions as libary that i think are great for different projects.\n\n
#               To use this file:  from pylibcklb.math-library.math_functions import SomeClassOrFunction\n  
#
# @pre          The library was developed with python 3.6 64 bit
#
# @bug          No bugs at the moment.

# @param loc  Mean (“centre”) of the distribution.
# @param scale Standard deviation (spread or “width”) of the distribution.
# @param size   Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., (m, n, k), then m * n * k samples are drawn. If size is None (default), a single value is returned if loc and 
#               scale are both scalars. Otherwise, np.broadcast(loc, scale).size samples are drawn.
# @return Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.
