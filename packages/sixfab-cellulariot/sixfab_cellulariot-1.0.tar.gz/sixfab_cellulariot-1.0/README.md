# Sixfab RPi Cellular IoT Library 
Python Library for Sixfab RPi Cellular IoT and Sixfab RPi Cellular IoT Application Hats

# Product Description
This is a hat that has combined LTE technologies Cat.M1, Cat.NB1 (NB-IoT) and eGPRS for Raspberry Pi, based on Quectel’s BG96 module. The hat has the power of new IoT phenomenon LPWA (Low Power Wide Area) with Cat.M1 and NB-IoT connection functionalities. Besides, it also provides the function of eGPRS that be enhanced version of classical GPRS.

The hat has GNSS (GPS, GLONASS etc.) functionality for the need of location, navigation, tracking, mapping and timing applications.

The design has built-in temperature, humidity, light sensors, 3-axis accelerometer, and a relay.
