Small sample script that shows how to get started with RedisCluster. It can also be found in [examples/basic.py](examples/basic.py)

```python
>>> from rediscluster import StrictRedisCluster

>>> # Requires at least one node for cluster discovery. Multiple nodes is recommended.
>>> startup_nodes = [{"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "7000"}]

>>> rc = StrictRedisCluster(startup_nodes=startup_nodes, decode_responses=True)

>>> rc.set("foo", "bar")
True
>>> print(rc.get("foo"))
'bar'

>>> rc.xadd("mystream", "*", 100,{"name": "data"})

>>> rc.xread("mystream","*",1ï¼Œ0)

>>> rc.xrange("mystream","-","+")

>>> rc.xreadgroup("group_name","consumer_name","mystream",">",0)
