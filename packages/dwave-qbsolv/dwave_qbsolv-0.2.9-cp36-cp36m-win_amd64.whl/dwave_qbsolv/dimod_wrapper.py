        Note:
            The qbsolv library being shared by all instances of this class is
            non-rentrant and not thread safe. The GIL should not be released
            by this method until that is resolved.

        Note:
            The default build of this library doesn't have the dw library,
            to use solver='dw' this module must be built from source with
            that library.

        The parameter solver given to this method has several valid forms:
            - (default) The string 'tabu': sub problems will be called via an internal call to tabu.
            - The string 'dw': sub problems will be given to the dw library.
            - an instance of a dimod sampler, the sample_qubo method will be invoked.
            - an callable that has the signature (qubo: dict, current_best: dict)
                and returns a result list/dictionary with the new solution

        Args:
            Q (dict): A dictionary defining the QUBO. Should be of the form
                {(u, v): bias} where u, v are variables and bias is numeric.
            num_repeats (int, optional): Determines the number of times to
                repeat the main loop in qbsolv after determining a better
                sample. Default 50.
            seed (int, optional): Random seed. Default generated by random module.
            algorithm (int, optional): Which algorithm to use. Defaut
                ENERGY_IMPACT. Algorithms numbers can be imported from module
                under the names ENERGY_IMPACT and SOLUTION_DIVERSITY.
            verbosity (int, optional): Print more detail about qbsolv's internal
                process as this number gets higher.
            timeout (float, optional): Number of seconds before routine halts. Default: 2592000
            solver: The sampling method for qbsolv to use, see method description.
            solver_limit (int, optional): The maximum number of variables in a sub problem.
            target (float, optional): If given the qbsolv process haults when
                a state with this energy value or better is discoverd. (default None)
            find_max (bool, optional): Switches the process from minimization to
                maximization. (default False, minimization)

        Returns:
