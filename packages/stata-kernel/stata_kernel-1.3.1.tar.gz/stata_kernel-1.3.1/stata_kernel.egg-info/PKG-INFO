        # Changelog
        
        ## [1.3.1] - 2018-08-13
        
        - Fix pip installation by adding CHANGELOG and requirements files to `MANIFEST.in`.
        
        ## [1.3.0] - 2018-08-13
        
        - Context-aware autocompletions
        - Support for #delimit; blocks interactively
        - Better parsing for when a user-provided block is complete or not. Typing `2 + ///` will prompt for the next line.
        - Split lexer into two lexers. This is helpful to first remove comments and convert #delimit; blocks to cr-delimited blocks.
        - Fix svg aspect ratio
        - Magics for plotting, retrieving locals and globals, timing commands, seeing current delimiter.
        - Add documentation website
        
        ## [1.2.0] - 2018-08-11
        
        - Support for `if`, `else`, `else if`, `cap`, `qui`, `noi`, `program`, `input` blocks #28, #27, #30
        - Support different graph formats #21
        - Heavily refactor codebase into hopefully more stable API #32
        - Correctly parse long, text wrapped lines from log file or console #41
        - Use a single cache directory, configurable by the user #43
        - Correctly remove comments, using a tokenizer #38, #25, #29
        
        
        ## [1.1.0] - 2018-08-06
        
        **Initial release!** This would ordinarily be something like version 0.1.0, but the Echo kernel framework that I made this from was marked as 1.1 internally, and I forgot to change that before people started downloading this. I don't want to move my number down to 0.1 and have people who already installed not be able to upgrade.
