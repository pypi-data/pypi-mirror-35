Description: ## django-clear-tables v0.1.2
        
        This is a simple django-app, registering a task called `django_clear_tables`.
        
        It will delete the contents of django's **Permission** and **ContentTypes** models 
        so you can load data from a fixture without problems. Normally, an initial `migrate` will 
        create permission and content-type data. If you want to clone data from another instance,
        to a fresh database, this data will clash with the `loaddata` command.  
        
        **Be careful** because it can also easily mess up your existing database. 
        
        Install it with:
        
        ```bash
        pip install django-clear-tables
        ```
        
        Usage is as follows:
        
        Add `django_clear_tables` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your django `settings.py`, then:
        
        ```bash
        # initially setup the database
        rm db.sqlite3  # or using mysql, pg, ...
        ./manage.py migrate
        # wipe the initially created data
        ./manage.py django_clear_tables
        # load a fixture from somewhere else
        ./manage.py loaddata dumpdata-from-another-instance.json
        ```
