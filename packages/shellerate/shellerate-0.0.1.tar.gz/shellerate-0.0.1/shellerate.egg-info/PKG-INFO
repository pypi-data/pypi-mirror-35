Description: # Shellerate
        
        This the Changelog file for the shellerate project. 'shellerate' is pun between
        'shell' and 'scellerato', the Italian word for 'wicked'.
        
        'shellerate' is a shellcode generation framework born from the assignments I
        took for the SecurityTube Linux Assembly Expert certification process.
        
        You can feature custom encoders, custom crypters, polymorphism and all stuff I
        learnt in the SLAE certification process.
