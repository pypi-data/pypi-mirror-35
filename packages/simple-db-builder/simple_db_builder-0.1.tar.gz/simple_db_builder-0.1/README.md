#### Simple DB Builder

This package will allow users to execute raw SQL strings, SQL stored in files, and Stored Procedures (in that order).

The `settings.json` file controlls all of the scripts that will execute and identifies the connection on which the scripts will run.

The `config.ini` file provides the connections names, details, and credentials.

This package has only been tested on MySQL.  Support for PostgreSQL is coming soon.
