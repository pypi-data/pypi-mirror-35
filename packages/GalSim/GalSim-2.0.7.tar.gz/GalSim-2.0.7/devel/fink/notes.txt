Process for updating fink with a new version:

- Make a new galsim-M.m.info file (copied from the previous one).
  (I keep these named by version number, but fink likes them as just galsim.info.)
- Update the Version and ShLibs.
- Add any new dependencies (or remove obsolete ones) if appropriate.
- Download the tagged tarball from GitHub.
- Get the md5sum value for it and update the Source-MD5 value.
- Make sure the SourceRename value matches the directory name in the tarball.
- export PYTHONPATH='/sw/lib/python3.6/site-packages/'
- cd /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/
- ln -s ~/GalSim/devel/fink/galsim-M.m.info galsim.info
- fink validate galsim.info
- fink -m --build-as-nobody rebuild galsim
- dpkg -c /sw/fink/debs/galsim_[...].deb  (Check that it seems to have everything and not more.)
- fink validate /sw/fink/debs/galsim_[...].deb
- fink install galsim
- otool -L /sw/lib/libgalsim[...].dylib  (Check the version number and directory.)
= otool -L /sw/lib/python3.6/site-packages/galsim/_galsim.so
- Make sure check_yaml works if you set python to /sw/bin/python3.6 and bin to /sw/bin
- In tests directory run /sw/bin/nosetests3.6
- git add new info file for this version.
- Submit to: http://sourceforge.net/p/fink/package-submissions/
  - Don't forget to change the name to galsim.info (without the version number).
  - Milestone = Undergoing Validation
  - Status = open
  - Mention that you have done the above tests.
