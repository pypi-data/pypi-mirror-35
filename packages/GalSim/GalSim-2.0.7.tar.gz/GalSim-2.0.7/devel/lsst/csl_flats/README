If you want to run these flat correlations, you need to do the following:

(1) Run ../treering_flat_csl_18apr18.py.  this will generate 10 flats each with 5 different intensities.
(2) Then run Flat_Correlations_18Apr18.py 5 times for each intensity:

Flat_Correlations_18Apr18.py 1
Flat_Correlations_18Apr18.py 2
Flat_Correlations_18Apr18.py 3
etc.

(3) Then run Plot_Correlations_Varying_Flux_Errors_18Apr18.py

This will generate the plots.  It isn't really necessary to split it up like this for small amounts of data, but I did this because calculating the correlations if you have thousands of flats takes hours, so I wrote one script to calculate the correlations and save the results to a file and second script to plot things.

As always, comments would be appreciated.
