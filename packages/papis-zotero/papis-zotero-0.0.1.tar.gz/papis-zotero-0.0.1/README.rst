==============================



Installation
------------

The general command that you have to hit is by using the ``setup.py`` script:

::

  python3 setup.py install


Again, if you want to install it locally because you don't have administrative rights
in your computer you can just simply type

::

  python3 setup.py install --user

If you want to develop on the code, you can also alternatively hit

::

  python3 setup.py develop --user
