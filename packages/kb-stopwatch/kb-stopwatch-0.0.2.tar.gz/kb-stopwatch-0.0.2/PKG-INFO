        This is a keyboard controlled stopwatch that runs in your terminal and
        works without window focus. Downside to the window focus thingâ€”you need
        to run this as root. But compromises, right?
        
        Anyway, this is good for ad-hoc speedrunning. Enjoy!
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run directly from source with
        
        ```
        sudo ./run_kbstopwatch.py
        ```
        
        or install with pip with
        
        ```
        pip3 install kb-stopwatch
        ```
        
        and run with
        
        ```
        sudo kb-stopwatch
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Press the control key, which currently is restricted to space, to start
        the stopwatch. Hit the control key again to stop the timer. Repeat as
        many times as desired.
