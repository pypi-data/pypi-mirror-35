# kb-stopwatch

This is a keyboard controlled stopwatch that runs in your terminal and
works without window focus. Downside to the window focus thingâ€”you need
to run this as root. But compromises, right?

Anyway, this is good for ad-hoc speedrunning. Enjoy!

## Usage

Run directly from source with

```
sudo ./run_kbstopwatch.py
```

or install with pip with

```
pip3 install kb-stopwatch
```

and run with

```
sudo kb-stopwatch
```
