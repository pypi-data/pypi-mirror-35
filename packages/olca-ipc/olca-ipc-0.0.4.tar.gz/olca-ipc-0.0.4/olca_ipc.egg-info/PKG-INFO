Description: olca-ipc.py
        ===========
        
        openLCA provides an `implementation <https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-modules/tree/master/olca-ipc>`_
        of an `JSON-RPC <http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification>`_ based protocol for
        inter-process communication (IPC). With this, it is possible to call functions
        in openLCA and processing their results outside of openLCA. The ``olca-ipc``
        package provides a convenience API for using this IPC protocol from standard
        Python (Cpython v3.6+) so that it is possible to use openLCA as a data storage
        and calculation engine and combine it with the libraries from the Python
        ecosystem.
        
        The openLCA IPC protocol is based on the openLCA data exchange format which is
        specified in the `olca-schema <https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-schema>`_
        repository. The ``olca-ipc`` package provides a class based implementation of
        the openLCA data exchange format and an API for communicating with an openLCA
        IPC server via instances of these classes.
        
        The current stable version of ``olca-ipc`` is available via the
        `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/olca-ipc/>`_. Thus, in order to
        use it, you can just install (and uninstall) it with pip:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install -U olca-ipc
        
        In order to communicate with openLCA, you first need to start an openLCA IPC
        server. You can do this via the user interface in openLCA under
        ``Window > Developer Tools > IPC Server``. The IPC server runs on a specific
        port, e.g. ``8080``, to which you connect from an IPC client:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import olca
            client = olca.Client(8080)
        
        An instance of the ``olca.Client`` class is then a convenient entry point for
        calling functions of openLCA and processing their results. Please see the
        `package documentation <https://olca-ipc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more
        information and examples.
