Description: *pysofa2* is a module for using `International Astronomical
         Union <http://www.iau.org/>`_'s `SOFA library <http://www.iausofa.org/>`_ in 
        python. It is inspired by original `pysofa <https://pypi.org/project/pysofa/>`_ 
        implementation of Frederic Grollier. It extends the original pysofa module by
        distributing and building the SOFA C library with the package, eliminiting the
        need for the end-user to build the libraries separaetly from the package 
        installtion.
        
        Like *pysofa*, *pysofa2* is not a port of SOFA routines but a wrapper around the 
        SOFA C library. Thus, no calculations are made into the pysofa software, they are
        all delegated to the underlying SOFA_C library.
        
        *pysofa2* not endorsed by the International Astronomical Union. 
        In addition to *pysofa2*'s MIT license, any use of this module should comply 
        with `SOFA's license and terms of use <http://www.iausofa.org/copyr.pdf>`_. 
        Especially, but not exclusively, any published work or commercial products 
        which includes results achieved by using *pysofa* shall acknowledge that the 
        SOFA software was used in obtaining those results.
