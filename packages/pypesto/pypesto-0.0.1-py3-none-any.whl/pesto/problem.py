class Problem:
    """
    The problem formulation. A problem specifies the objective function,
    boundaries and constraints, parameter guesses as well as the parameters
    which are to be optimized.

    Parameters
    ----------

    objective: pesto.Objective
        The objective function for minimization.

    lb, ub: array_like
        The lower and upper bounds. For unbounded problems set to inf.

    par_guesses: array_like
        Guesses for the parameter values, shape (dim, g) where g denotes the
        number of guesses. These are used as start points in the optimization.
