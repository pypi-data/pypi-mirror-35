# nestpy

(Not ready for use)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NESTCollaboration/nestpy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NESTCollaboration/nestpy)

These are the Python bindings for the [NEST library](https://github.com/NESTCollaboration/nest).  You do not have to have NEST already installed to use this package.

## Installing from PyPI

For nearly all systems, instally 'nestpy' should just require running:

```
pip install nestpy
```

You can then test that it works by running the example above.

## Installing from source

Requirements: You must have CMake>=2.8.12 and a C++11 compatible compiler (GCC>=4.8) to build.

First, you must check out this repository then simply run the installer:

```
git checkout https://github.com/NESTCollaboration/nestpy
cd nestpy
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

Python bindings to the NEST library:

```
from nestpy import nestpy
nestpy.NESTcalc().BinomFluct(10, 0.2)
```

Install with `python setup.py install` (PyPI will come later) and be sure to have CMake and a C++ compatible compiler.
