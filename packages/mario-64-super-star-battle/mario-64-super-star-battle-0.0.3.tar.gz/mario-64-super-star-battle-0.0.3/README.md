The ultimate competition between Mario 64 superstars! Fight in a best
of "X" over who can six-star complete more levels, faster!

## Rules

This is for two players. One player is randomly selected to be the first
player. That player selects a course, and, timed, completes all 6 stars
for that course (not including the 100 coins star—but you can include it
if you wish) while the other player observes. Then the next player gets
timed performing the same run.

After that round, the player with the quickest time gets a point. The
player who went second last round now goes first for the next round.

Repeat until one superstar emerges victorious.

If the players get to the last round, they must collectively decide
which of the remaining stages to play. The best way to do this is with a
ban system, but that's for you to decide.
