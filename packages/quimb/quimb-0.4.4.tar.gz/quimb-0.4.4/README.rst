----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`quimb <https://github.com/jcmgray/quimb>`_ is an easy but fast python library for quantum information and many-body calculations, including with tensor networks. The code is hosted on `github <https://github.com/jcmgray/quimb>`_, do please submit any issues or pull requests there. It is also thoroughly unit-tested and the tests might be the best place to look for detailed documentation.

The **core** ``quimb`` module:

* Uses straight ``numpy`` and ``scipy.sparse`` matrices as quantum objects
* Accelerates many operations using `numba <https://numba.pydata.org>`_ and `numexpr <https://github.com/pydata/numexpr>`_
* Makes it easy to construct operators in large tensor spaces (e.g. 2D lattices)
* Uses efficient methods to compute various quantities including entanglement measures
* Has a wide variety of built-in states and operators, including those based on fast, multi-threaded random number generation
* Can perform evolutions with several methods, computing quantities on the fly
* Has an optional `slepc4py <https://bitbucket.org/slepc/slepc4py>`_ interface for easy distributed (MPI) linear algebra. This can massively increase the performance when seeking, for example, mid-spectrum eigenstates

The **tensor network** submodule ``quimb.tensor``:

* Uses a geometry free representation of tensor networks
* Uses `opt_einsum <https://github.com/dgasmith/opt_einsum>`_ to find efficient contraction orders for hundreds of tensors, and perform those contractions potentially on the GPU
* Can plot any network, color-coded, with bond size represented
* Can treat any network as a scipy ``LinearOperator``, allowing many decompositions
* Can perform DMRG1, DMRG2 and DMRGX, in matrix product state language
* Has tools to efficiently address periodic problems (transfer matrix compression and pseudo-orthogonalization)
* Can perform MPS time evolutions with TEBD
