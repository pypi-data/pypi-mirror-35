Description: # PyCharmSync
        
        A simple tool for uploading changed project files to a remote host,
         automatically.
        
        Paid versions of PyCharm can be set up to upload project files
        as you change them locally. `PyCharmSync` aims to do just that 
        using the `sshpass` and the `scp` command on Unix based machines.
        
        `PyCharmSync` will watch a project directory, track the files in
        the directory and then upload the changed versions automatically
        based on settings set in an `.env` file in your root project 
        directory.
        
        ## `.env` Example
        
        Here are some settings for a project named `project_name` on a 
        raspberry pi.  The `.env` file should be consumable by `configparser.ConfigParser`
        
            [SSH]
            HOST = 10.0.0.200
            USER = pi
            PASS = raspberry
            PROJECT_ROOT = /home/pi/project_name
        
        The settings laid out above would map to the following command:
        
            sshpass -p "PASS" scp FILEPATH USER@HOST:PROJECT_ROOT
        
        or
        
            sshpass -p "raspberry" scp /home/user/project_name/some_file.py pi@10.0.0.200:/home/pi/project_name
        
        ## Usage Example
        
        Once you have your `.env` file configured in your project's root
        directory all you need to do is import `ProjectSync` from `PyCharmSync`
        and then run it's `main` method:
        
        ```python
        from PyCharmSync import ProjectSync
        
        ProjectSync.main()
        ```
        
        If you are not running the `main` method from your project's root 
        directory you need to pass a `cwd` to the `main` method.
        
        ```python
        from PyCharmSync import ProjectSync
        
        ProjectSync.main('/home/user/project_name')
        ```
