        How to setup
        ============
        
        Configure access to your bank
        -----------------------------
        Create your Bank
          Open *Banking/Banks* and create your bank. The value for the *FinTS-URL* can 
          be found on the website 'https://www.hbci-zka.de/institute/institut_auswahl.htm', 
          search for your bank and copy the value for *PIN/TAN-URL*.
        Create Account
          Open *Banking/Account*. Create an account and enter owner, currency, 
          and the bank you just created. Your company must be the owner of the bank account to 
          allow online access. Create a 'Number'. Enter your IBAN and activate 'enable online 
          access'. In 'FinTS-Login' enter the login name for your online account.
          You can also enter the PIN.  If you leave the field blank, you will be 
          prompted for the PIN each time you access online banking.
        Check connection
          Open *Banking/Account*, mark the accounts to be checked. Click the action 
          button and select 'Check bank access'. If the connection works, 
          the dialog will display the list of available SEPA accounts.  
        
        Create journals
        ---------------
        Journal for account transactions
          In *Finance/Configuration/Journals/Journals* create a new entry and enter a name, 
          e.g. 'BankXY bookings', the type is 'statement'. Enter in *Default Debit Account*
          and *Default Credit Account* an account from your chart of accounts. In the german 
          SKR04 for example '1810'. This account will receive all account movements of your 
          bank account. In *sequence* use the existing 'Default Account Journal'.
        Statement Journal
          In *Finance/Configuration/Statements/Statement Journals* create a new entry and 
          enter a name, eg 'BankXY statements'. Enter the other values: *Currency:* Euro, 
          *Journal:* the journal created above, *Company:* your company, 
          *Bank Account:* the bank account created above, *Validation Type:* Balance. 
          This journal will contain the bank statements.
        
        Permissions
        -----------
        *Account Statement FinTS - edit logindata*
          allows the user to change the connection settings and the login data to the bank
        *Account Statement FinTS - online access*
          allows the user online access to the bank
        
        The following permissions are required for a user to fetch the account statements:
          - Account Statement FinTS online access
          - Account
        
        In order to allow the automatic generation of bank accounts of the payer/payee 
        the user needs the permission 'Bank Adminstration'.
        
        
        Pick up bank statements
        =======================
        Open *Finance/Statements/Statements*, click the action button and then 
        'Import bank statements online'. The wizard will guide you through the 
        import. For new payments, a statement is created in draft mode. 
        You can then check and commit the statement.
        
        Invoices that have to be paid are automatically linked with appropriate
        lines of the bank statement if: the invoice number appears in the purpose 
        and the amount corresponds to the invoice amount.
