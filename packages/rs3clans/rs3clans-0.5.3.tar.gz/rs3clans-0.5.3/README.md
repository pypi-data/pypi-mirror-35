- Since i have rewritten the entire module, i still haven't remade the docs for it. Read the comments in the source code instead. There are a few examples of usage in it as well, just run it and have a look. Also look into the 'tests' folder for some examples. Trying to make time to write this :/ 

- Either way it's not a very complex module, couple minutes should get you going.
