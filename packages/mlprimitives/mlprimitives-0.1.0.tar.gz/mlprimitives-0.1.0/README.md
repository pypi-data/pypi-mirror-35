## Overview

This repository contains JSON primitives to be used by the MLBlocks library, as well as the
necessary Python code to make some of the comply with the MLBlocks API requirements.

There are is also a colleciton of custom primitives contributed directly to this library,
which either combine third party tools or implement new functionalities from scratch.

## Project Structure

The project is divided in two parts

### `mlblocks_primitives` folder

The `mlblocks_primitives` folder contains the actual MLBlocks JSON primitives.

### `mlprimitives` folder

The mlprimitives folder is where the python code can be found.
