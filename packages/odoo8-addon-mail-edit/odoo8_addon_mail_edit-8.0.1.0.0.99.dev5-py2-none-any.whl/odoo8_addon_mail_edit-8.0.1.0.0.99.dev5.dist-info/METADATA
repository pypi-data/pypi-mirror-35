============
Message Edit
============

This module extends the functionality of mail. You can edit message/messages
and move them to any model.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module:

* Activate the 'Move mail message' or 'Edit mail message' permissions for a
  user (the admin user has these rights by default)
* Objects that users are allowed to move messages to, can be
  configured in Settings - Technical - Database structure -
  Referenceable objects.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Go to *Message* *Chatter* in any model, click the Edit (pen) Icon to open up
  the 'Edit or Move' wizard.
* To edit, edit the Mail as necessary and click Save.
* To move, select the destination object and click Save.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================
* Does not reload after edit on messaging views. For this we needed to call
  controller.reload(), a way to this would be to inherit the ActionManager and
  call it from there.
