        Mandrill
        ========
        
        .. note::
        
           The upstream upstream version of mandrill-api-python appears maintained with
           reasonable PRs unmerged for over a year. This fork exists to merge such PRs
           until Mailchimp manage to get around to maintaining their own software.
           Help with code review really welcomed.
        
        Mandrill is a Python API client and suite of CLI-based tools for the Mandrill
        email as a platform service.
        
        The API client is comprehensive, but the CLI functionality is minimal at this time.
        
        * Examples::
        
              import mandrill
        
              client = mandrill.Mandrill('YOUR_API_KEY')
              print client.users.ping()
        
        * CLI Examples::
        
              mandrill setup
              mandrill ping -c10
              mandrill send -f from@example.com -t to@example.com -s "My Subject Line" < content.html
