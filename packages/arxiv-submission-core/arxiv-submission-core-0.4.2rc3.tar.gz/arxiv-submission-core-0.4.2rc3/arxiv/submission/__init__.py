"""
Core event-centric data abstraction for the submission & moderation subsystem.

This package provides an event-based API for CRUD operations on submissions
and submission-related (meta)data. Management of submission content (i.e.
source files) is out of scope.

Rather than perform CRUD operations directly on submission objects, all
operations that modify submission data are performed through the creation of
submission events. This ensures that we have a precise and complete record of
activities concerning submissions, and provides an explicit definition of
operations that can be performed within the arXiv submission system.

Event classes are defined in :mod:`arxiv.submission.domain.event`, and are accessible
from the root namespace of this package. Each event type defines a
transformation/operation on a single submission, and defines the data required
to perform that operation. Events are played forward, in order, to derive the
state of a submission. For more information about how event types are defined,
see :class:`arxiv.submission.domain.event.Event`.

Using events
============

Event types are `PEP 557 data classes
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/>`_. Each event type inherits from
:class:`.Event`, and may add additional fields. See :class:`.Event` for more
information about common fields.

To create a new event, initialize the class with the relevant
data, and commit the event using :func:`.save`. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from arxiv.submission import User, SetTitle, save
   >>> user = User(123, "joe@bloggs.com")
   >>> update = SetTitle(creator=user, title='A new theory of foo')
   >>> submission = save(creation, submission_id=12345)


Several things will occur:

1. If the events are for a submission that already exists, the latest state of
   that submission will be obtained.
2. New events will be validated and applied to the submission in the order that
   they were passed to :func:`.save`. If an event is invalid (e.g. the
   submission is not in an appropriate state for the operation), an
   :class:`.InvalidEvent` exception will be raised. Note that at this point
   nothing has been changed in the database; the attempt is simply abandoned.
3. The new events are stored in the database, as is the latest state of the
   submission. Creation of events and creation/update of the submission are
   performed as a single atomic transaction. If anything goes wrong during the
   update operation, all changes are abandoned and a :class:`.RuntimeError`
   exception is raised.
4. If the notification service is configured, a message about the event is
   propagated as a Kinesis event on the configured stream. See
   :mod:`arxiv.submission.services.notification` for details.


Special case: creation
----------------------
Note that if the first event is a :class:`.CreateSubmission` the
submission ID need not be provided, as we won't know what it is yet. For
example:

.. code-block:: python

   from arxiv.submission import User, CreateSubmission, SetTitle, save

   >>> user = User(123, "joe@bloggs.com")
   >>> creation = CreateSubmission(creator=user)
   >>> update = SetTitle(creator=user, title='A new theory of foo')
   >>> submission = save(creation, update)
   >>> submission.submission_id
   40032
