autoslot
========

Automatic "__slots__".

Demo
----

.. code-block:: python

   from autoslot import Slots

   class Compact(Slots):
       def __init__(self, a, b):
           self.x = a
           self.y = b

This produces *exactly* the same class as if you had done:

.. code-block:: python

   class Compact:
       __slots__ = {'x', 'y'}
       def __init__(self, a, b):
           self.x = a
           self.y = b

Simply: the code inside ``__init__()`` is scanned to find all assignments
to attributes on ``self``, and these are added as ``__slots__``.

The benefit of using ``autoslot.Slots`` over a manual slots declaration is
that you can modify the
code inside the ``__init__()`` method to add more attributes, and those
changes will *automatically* be reflected in the ``__slots__`` definition.

You can also have the best of both worlds: slots for fields you expect,
**as well as** a ``__dict__`` for those you don't:

.. code-block:: python

   from autoslot import SlotsPlusDict

   class SemiCompact(SlotsPlusDict):
       def __init__(self, a, b):
           self.x = a
           self.y = b

   inst = SemiCompact(1, 2)
   inst.z = 123  # <-- This won't fail!

Attributes ``x`` and ``y`` will be stored in slots, while all other
dynamically-assigned attributes will go into the usual ``__dict__`` instance
inside the class.  If most of your class's attributes appear in the ``__init__()``
method (these will become slots), then the space bloat caused by dictionary
hash-table expansion will be contained to only the dynamically-assigned
attributes.

How does it work?
-----------------

See for yourself! The code is tiny.

In words: the metaclass finds the ``__init__()`` method, if present, and
accesses its bytecode. It looks for all assignments to attributes of
``self``, and considers those to be desired ``__slots__`` entries. Then the
metaclass injects ``__slots__`` into the namespace of the class definition
and thereafter allows class creation to proceed as normal.
