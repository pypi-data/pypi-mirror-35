Description: foowise
        --------
        
        Infomorphic channels ([Barwise and Seligman, 1997][blue book]) rigorously formalize what it means for data to carry meaning across time, space, and subjectivity.
        
        The purpose this repository to is to mechanize the underlying theory, and to demonstrate a few interesting applications.
