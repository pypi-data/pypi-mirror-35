Virtual Crossmatch for molecular HLA typing data


Description
===========

Virtual crossmatch for solid organ transplantation is done by cross referencing candidate's unacceptable antigens
with donor's HLA typing. This manual process is laborious when donor's HLA typing is ambiguous and candidate has
allele specific antibodies. VICTOR: VIrtual CrossmaTch for mOlecular typing data is a web application that computes
virtual crossmatch for unambiguous and ambiguous HLA typing data and antigen specific or allele specific alloantibodies.
