Description: Overview
        ========
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        ``sigpy`` is a Python package for signal reconstruction, with GPU support using ``cupy``.
        
        ``sigpy`` provides commonly used signal processing functions, including convolution, FFT, NUFFT, wavelet transform, and thresholding functions. All operations, except wavelet transform, can run on GPU. These operations are wrapped in a linear operator class (``Linop``) or a proximal operator class (``Prox``) for easy usage in iterative algorithms. ``sigpy`` also implements commonly used iterative algorithms, such as conjugate gradient, (accelerated/proximal) gradient method, and primal dual hybrid gradient.
        
        ``sigpy`` provides a submodule ``sigpy.mri`` that uses the core module to implement common MRI iterative reconstruction methods, including SENSE reconstruction, L1-wavelet reconstruction, total-variation reconstruction, and JSENSE reconstruction. In addition, it provides convenient simulation and sampling functions, such as poisson-disc sampling function.
        
        ``sigpy`` also provides a preliminary submodule ``sigpy.learn`` that implements convolutional sparse coding, and linear regression.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        The package is on PyPI, and can be installed via pip:
        
        	pip install sigpy
        
        For optional gpu support, the package requires ``cupy``.
        
        For optional distributed programming support, the package requires ``mpi4py``.
        	
        Alternatively, the package can be installed from source with the following requirements:
        
        - python3
        - numpy
        - scipy
        - pywavelets
        - numba
