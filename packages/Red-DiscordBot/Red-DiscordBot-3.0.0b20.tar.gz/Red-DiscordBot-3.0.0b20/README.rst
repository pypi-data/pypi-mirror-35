==========
Overview
==========

Red is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your liking, making it completely customizable.  
This is also a *self-hosted bot* – meaning you will need to host and maintain your own instance. You can turn Red into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot, new best friend or all of these together!  

`Installation <#installation>`_ is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Aside from installation and updating, every part of the bot can be controlled from within Discord.

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Trivia (lists are included and can be easily added)
- Music features (YouTube, SoundCloud, local files, playlists, queues)
- Stream alerts (Twitch, Youtube, Mixer, Hitbox, Picarto)
- Slot machine
- Custom commands
- Imgur/gif search


**Additionally, other plugins (cogs) can be easily found and added from our growing community of cog repositories.**

- Cleverbot integration (talk to Red and she talks back)
- Ban sync
- Welcome messages
- Casino
- Reaction roles
- Slow Mode
- Anilist
- And much, much more!
