Installation
============

* Dependencies

 -  numpy, scipy  ->  Mandatory, automatically installed by pip
 -  Pillow        ->  Mandatory, for reading of SAXS images, automatic install by pip
 -  matplotlib    ->  Mandatory, for 3D plots
 -  Ipython       ->  Optional, for convenience as a powerfull python shell
 -  gfortran      ->  Optional, without some functions dont work or use only slower python
 -  xmgrace       ->  Optional, prefered plotting on Unix like (use matplotlib on Windows)

Installation may need root privileges. Use "sudo" on Linux and MacOS if needed.

* Pip installation options (use pip2 or pip3 dependent if you use python2.7 or python3) ::

   sudo pip install jscatter

  As user in home directory (pip default is in ~/.local/).
  No sudo needed, only user privileges::

   pip install jscatter --user

  from a local repository (development versions)::

   pip install jscatter --user --upgrade --pre --find-links /where/the/file/is/saved

   options
   --user       : Install in user directory (folder defined by PYTHONUSERBASE or the default ~/.local)
   --find-links : look in the given path for package links e.g development releases
   --upgrade    : to install upgrades
   --pre        : to install also development versions

* Ubuntu, all Debian related Linux ::

   sudo apt-get install gfortran grace python-matplotlib  # or python3-matplotlib
   sudo pip install ipython
   sudo pip install jscatter

* MacOs, install Homebrew first as given on their web page (see `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_) ::

   # install XQuartz from homebrew or from the AppStore
   sudo brew cask install xquartz
   # install xmgrace and gfortran
   sudo brew install grace gfortran matplotlib
   # then use pip
   sudo pip install ipython
   sudo pip install jscatter


* Anaconda is a python distribution as easy alternative for MacOs and Windows
  (also working on Linux)  with numpy, scipy, matplotlib, Ipython preinstalled.
  Need of sudo depends on how Anaconda was installed::

   # install xmgrace (only Linux/OSX)
   conda install -c uvcdat xmgrace
   # install gfortran
   conda install -c uvcdat gfortran
   # install jscatter
   pip install jscatter

* Manjaro Linux (yaourt ask for permission as root or prepend sudo as above)  ::

   # install gfortran
   yaourt gcc-fortran
   # install xmgrace (only found in AUR)
   yaourt xorg-fonts-75 xorg-fonts-100 grace-openmotif python-matplotlib
   pip install ipython
   pip install jscatter

* CONTIN in DLS module (Only if needed).

  See DLS module documentation for details how to get and compile the original fortran code.

* Testing

  You can test basic functionality of jscatter after installation::

   import jscatter as js
   js.test.doTest()


  During development::

   python setup.py test
