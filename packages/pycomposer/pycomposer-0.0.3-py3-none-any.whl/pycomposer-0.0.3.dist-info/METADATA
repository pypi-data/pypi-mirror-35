Summary: pycomposer is Python library for Algorithmic Composition or Automatic Composition based on the stochastic music theory. Especialy, this library provides apprication of the generative model such as a Restricted Boltzmann Machine(RBM). And the Monte Carlo method such as Quantum Annealing model is used in this library as optimizer of compositions.

pycomposer is Python library for Algorithmic Composition or Automatic Composition by Reinforcement Learning such as Q-Learning and Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine(RTRBM). Q-Learning and RTRBM in this library allows you to extract the melody information about a MIDI tracks and these models can learn and inference patterns of the melody. And This library has wrapper class for converting melody data inferenced by Q-Learning and RTRBM into MIDI file.
