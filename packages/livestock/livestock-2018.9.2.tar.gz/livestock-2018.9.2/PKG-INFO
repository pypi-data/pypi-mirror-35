        # Livestock
        Livestock is a package for Grasshopper providing components for modelling water movement and hydrothermal effects 
        around buildings to enable and evaluate sustainable solutions, where those effects are incorporated.
        
        We have two focus areas: Surface Water Run-Off and Outdoor Thermal Comfort.
        Livestock provides couplings to the hygrothermal modeling environment CMF as well as mesh capabilities used in Blender.
        We are using CMF - [Catchment Modelling Framework](https://github.com/philippkraft/cmf) as our base for hydrological 
        modelling. The hydrologic models can be used to investigate storm water management solutions at a high accuracy or 
        be used as an input to an outdoor thermal comfort model.
        
        Livestock aims at being a high performance package, by implementing the 
        [Livestock Template Method (LTM)](https://ocni-dtu.github.io/how-is-it-working.html) for fast and scalable computations.
        The LTM is a protocol and method to couple various CPython modules to Grasshopper. Livestock provides an easy way to 
        read and write Python code back and forth between IronPython and CPython.
        
        Livestock consists of a series of Grasshopper Python Script components and a 
        underlying collection of Python scripts and a PyPI package

        Livestock is the name of the plug-in for Grasshopper, that has been developed 
        for the [master thesis](https://ocni-dtu.github.io/pages/portfolio.html) of Christian Kongsgaard. 
        Livestock is currently being developed and maintained by Christian Kongsgaard and Kristoffer Negendahl. Livestock is 
        under continuous development to provide validated analysis tools through the vast packages available on PyPI, Conda and 
        elsewhere in the Open-Source world.

        ## Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer: 
        I want your help. No really, I do.
        There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn 
        another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.
        I assure you, that's not the case.
        This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations that you can read [here](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
        
        The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations 
        and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.
        And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback 
        about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)
        Thank you for contributing!
