Description: PyExPool is a concurrent execution pool with custom resource constraints (memory, timeouts, affinity, CPU cores and caching) and load balancing of the external applications on NUMA architecture.  All main functionality is implemented as a single-file module to be easily included into your project and customized as a part of your distribution (like in [PyCaBeM](https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/PyCABeM) to execute multiple apps in parallel on the dedicated CPU cores and avoiding their swapping from the main memory), also it can be installed as a library. An optional minimalistic Web interface is provided in the separate module to inspect the load balancer and execution pool. Typically, PyExPool is used as an application framework for benchmarking, load testing or other heavy-loaded multi-process execution activities on constrained computational resources. PyExPool is convenient for the fine-grained resource control (including apps execution on the specific number of the optionally dedicated logical CPUs) and for the failover execution.
        > [hwloc / lstopo](http://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/hwloc-Which-Processor-Is-Running-Your-Service) should be additionally installed if customized CPU affinity masking and cache control are required, see [Requirements](#requirements) section.
