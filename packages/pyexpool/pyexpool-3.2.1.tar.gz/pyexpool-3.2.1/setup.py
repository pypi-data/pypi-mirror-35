    ' constraints (memory, timeouts, affinity, CPU cores and caching) and load'
    ' balancing of the external applications on NUMA architecture.  '
	'All main functionality is implemented as a single-file module to be easily'
	' included into your project and customized as a part of your distribution '
	'(like in [PyCaBeM](https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/PyCABeM) to execute'
	' multiple apps in parallel on the dedicated CPU cores and avoiding their'
	' swapping from the main memory), also it can be installed as a library.'
	' An optional minimalistic Web interface is provided in the separate module'
	' to inspect the load balancer and execution pool.'
	' Typically, PyExPool is used as an application framework for benchmarking,'
	' load testing or other heavy-loaded multi-process execution activities on'
	' constrained computational resources. PyExPool is convenient for the fine-grained'
	' resource control (including apps execution on the specific number of the'
	' optionally dedicated logical CPUs) and for the failover execution.'

	# You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
	# simple. Or you can use find_packages().
	#
	# Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
	# the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
	# called `my_module.py` to exist:
	#
	# py_modules=["my_module"],

	# packages=['pyexpool'],

	# This field lists other packages that your project depends on to run.
	# Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your project is
	# installed, so they must be valid existing projects.

		# For Python2
		, 'future;python_version<"3"', 'enum34>=1;python_version<"3.4"'],  # Optional

	# List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development
	# dependencies). Users will be able to install these using the "extras"
	# syntax, for example:
	#
	#   $ pip install sampleproject[dev]
	#
	# Similar to `install_requires` above, these must be valid existing
	# projects.

	# If there are data files included in your packages that need to be

	#
	# If using Python 2.6 or earlier, then these have to be included in
	# MANIFEST.in as well.

	# Include bottle template views and docs

		# Note: images are relatively heavy, wildcards/regexp are not supported out of the box

	# Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
	# need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
	# http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files
	#
	# In this case, 'data_file' will be installed into '<sys.prefix>/my_data'

	# To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
	# "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
	# `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
	# platform.
	#
	# For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
	# executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
	# entry_points={  # Optional

	# issues, where the source is hosted, where to say thanks to the package
	# maintainers, and where to support the project financially. The key is
	# what's used to render the link text on PyPI.
