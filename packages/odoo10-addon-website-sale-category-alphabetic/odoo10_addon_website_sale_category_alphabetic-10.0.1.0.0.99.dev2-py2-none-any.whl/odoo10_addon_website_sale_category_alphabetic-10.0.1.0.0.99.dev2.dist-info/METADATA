==================================
Website Sale - Alphabetic Category
==================================

This module automatically places each new product in an alphabetic website 
category based on the first character of the product's name. There are two 
catch-all buckets (``#`` for numbers and ``*`` for other non-alphabetic 
characters), and the categories are created on demand, with a shared parent 
category called ``Alphabetical``.

Known Issues / Roadmap
======================

All unicode characters should be supported, but the module is only intended 
for use with English and may not produce ideal results with other languages 
(e.g. ``Ã‰`` will not be grouped with ``E`` or listed between ``E`` and ``F`` 
in the website category menu).
