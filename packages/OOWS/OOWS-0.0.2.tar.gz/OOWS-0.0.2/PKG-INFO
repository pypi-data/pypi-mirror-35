Description: # OOWS
        
        **Warning — this project is in early development. Contributions and feedbacks are welcome. Usage in production systems is discouraged**
        
        OOWS (_oh-owls_) is an object-oriented friendly client for Amazon Web Services — AWS. It is based on [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) official client and aims to provide a cleaner and more Pythonic interface to handle AWS resources.
        
        Currently, Boto3 already provides [the Resource Model](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/core/resources.html) which is a nicer and more OO-friendly interface over raw JSON, [as explained here](https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/112#issuecomment-100377492). Although it works, it does not provide an interface for resources I currently need. This project started by a personal need of mine to ease the current state of programmatic access to ECS resources.
        
        ## Rationale
        
        Suppose you want to list all of a cluster's services' task definitions. Using pure `boto3`, you'd need to write something like:
        
        ```python
        session = boto3.Session()
        ecs_client = session.client('ecs')
        services = ecs_client.list_services(cluster="MyCluster")['serviceArns']
        for service in services:
            s = ecs_client.describe_services(cluster="MyCluster", services=[service])
            print("The task definition is {}".format(s['services'][0]['taskDefinition']))
        ```
        
        But using `oows`, you can rewrite this code to something like:
        
        ```python
        cluster = Cluster("MyCluster")
        
        for service in cluster.services:
            print("The task definition is {}".format(service.task_definition))
        ```
