        Ansible Networking ML2 Driver
        
        Networking-Ansible is a Neutron ML2 driver that abstracts the interaction with
        switch hardware to Ansible Networking. This driver may not be tested with all
        the modules included with Ansible Networking. In theory it should work with any
        switch that has compatible modules included with Ansible Networking.
