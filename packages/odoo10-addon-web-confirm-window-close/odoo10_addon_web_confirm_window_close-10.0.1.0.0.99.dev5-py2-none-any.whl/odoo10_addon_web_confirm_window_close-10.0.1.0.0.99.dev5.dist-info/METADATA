==================================================
Check for unsaved data when closing browser window
==================================================

This module will show a confirmation dialog when the user closes
a window with an Odoo form containing unsaved data.

Known issues
============
This module depends on the 'dirty' flag that Odoo sets on modified forms. Odoo
only sets this flag when the focus is changed, so if you modified only one
field and the focus is still on that field, you won't be prevented from closing
the browser window.

Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/web/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
