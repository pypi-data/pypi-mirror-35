Description: # pyviz_comms
        
        Offers a simple bidirectional communication architecture for PyViz tools
        including support for Jupyter comms in both the classic notebook and
        Jupyterlab.
        
        There are two installable components in this repository: a Python
        component used by various PyViz tools and an extension to enable
        Jupyterlab support.
        
        ## Installing the Jupyterlab extension
        
        Jupyterlab users will need to install the Jupyterlab pyviz extension:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz
        ```
        
        ## Developing the Jupyterlab extension
        
        For a development install (requires npm version 4 or later), do the following in the repository directory:
        
        ```bash
        npm install
        jupyter labextension link .
        ```
        
        To rebuild the package and the JupyterLab app:
        
        ```bash
        npm run build
        jupyter lab build
        ```
        
        ## The ``pyviz_comms`` Python package
        
        The ``pyviz_comms`` Python package is used by pyviz projects and can be
        pip and conda installed.
