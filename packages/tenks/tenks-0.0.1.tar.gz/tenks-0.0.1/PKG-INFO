Description: Tenks
        =====
        
        Tenks is a utility that manages virtual bare metal clusters for development and
        testing purposes.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        Tenks has dependencies on Ansible roles that are hosted by Ansible Galaxy.
        Given that your virtualenv of choice is active and Ansible (>=2.6) is
        installed inside it, Tenks' role dependencies can be installed by
        `ansible-galaxy install --role-file=requirements.yml
        --roles-path=ansible/roles/`.
        
        Currently, Tenks does not have a CLI or wrapper. A virtual cluster can be
        deployed by configuring the variables defined in `group_vars/*` as necessary,
        then calling `ansible-playbook --inventory ansible/inventory ansible/deploy.yml`.
