        and Agent.

        cyborg-api supports GET/POST/PUT/DELETE operations for accelerators.

        cyborg-conductor is responsible for handling all API requests that come in

        via the API service.

        cyborg-agent is responsible for all the Nova Cyborg interaction.

        It should be noted that for operations that are not associated with DB change,

        the cyborg-api could directly call cyborg-agent.

        The cyborg-nova-interaction spec serves as the main spec defines the interaction

        mechanism between Cyborg and Nova is via Placement to which cyborg-conductor

        will periodically report the accelerator resource info, which is acquired
        via

        resource tracker functionality in the agent.

        The cyborg-internal-api spec defines the internal api that is mainly used
        for

        internal communication between conductor/agent and driver.

        The cyborg-fpga-model-proposal spec defines the first tryout of data modeling
        of

        accelerator resources via resource provider. Two types of tables (accelerator

        for base PF and deployable for VF) are defined there and nested resource

        provider will be utilized in Rocky release.
