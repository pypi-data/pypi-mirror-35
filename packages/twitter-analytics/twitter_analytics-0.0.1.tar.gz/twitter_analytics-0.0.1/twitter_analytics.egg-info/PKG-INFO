Description: Twitter analytics downloader
        ========
        
        This script downloads the tweets report from the analytics section of a twitter account (including impressions). It takes only the last 28 days (default period)
        This was created so we can get impressions data for every tweets. This metric is not available via API.
        
        
        Installation
        
        Selenium uses a few binaries (Chromedriver, xvfb) that needs to be installed beforehand with the following command:
        
        ```commandline
        $ sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver xvfb
        
        ```
        
        ####TODO:
        
        * Add a command line interface to be able to launch for any twitter account on the fly.
        * Add a monitoring tool to track when script breaks (it will, this is selenium).
