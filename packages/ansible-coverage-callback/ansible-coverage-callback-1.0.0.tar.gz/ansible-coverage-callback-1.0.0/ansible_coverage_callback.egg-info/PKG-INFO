Description: # ansible-coverage-callback
        
        Coverage Tool for Ansible.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * Ansible >=2.4
        
        ## Installation
        
        * Copy `callback_plugins/coverage.py` to your playbook callback directory (by default `callback_plugins/` in your playbook's root directory). Create the directory if it doesn't exist;
        * Be sure to whitelist the plugin in your `ansible.cfg`:
        
        ```
        [defaults]
        callback_whitelist = coverage
        ```
        
        ## Skip coverage tag
        
        You may skip task or tasks from coverage report by adding `skip_coverage` tag:
        
        ```
        ---
        - name: Test handler
          command: whoami
          when:
            - test_var == False
          tags:
            - skip_coverage
        ```
        
        ## Acknowledged issues
        
        * Imported handlers has no tags, so they can't be skipped
        * There is some magic hacks for skipping Molecule's system playbooks
        * Tasks from non imported files are not counted
