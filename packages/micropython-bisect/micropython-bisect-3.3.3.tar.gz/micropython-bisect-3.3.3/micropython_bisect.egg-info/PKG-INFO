Description: This is a module ported from CPython standard library to be compatible with
        MicroPython interpreter. Usually, this means applying small patches for
        features not supported (yet, or at all) in MicroPython. Sometimes, heavier
        changes are required. Note that CPython modules are written with availability
        of vast resources in mind, and may not work for MicroPython ports with
        limited heap. If you are affected by such a case, please help reimplement
        the module from scratch.
Platform: UNKNOWN
