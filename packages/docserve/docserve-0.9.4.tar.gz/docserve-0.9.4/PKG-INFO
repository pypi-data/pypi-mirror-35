Description: # DocServe
        
        A tool for quick and easy Markdown project documentation.
        
        DocServe renders an adapted Markdown to provide:
        
        * Images, Video, YouTube links, CSV tables.
        * Code highlighting.
        * File download blocks.
        * Lists and Tables.
        * Document defined template selection.
        * Document Meta-data.
        * Auto-generated index sidebar.
        
        DocServe can be used as a server to:
        
        * Output documents as insecure HTML on a localhost.
        * Output documents as PDF files via the HTML server.
        
        DocServe can also:
        
        * Create a **static** set of HTML files that contain the documentation and related resources.
        
        Basic usage with the default template:
        
        ```bash
        python -m pip install docserve
        mkdir docs
        vim docs/home.md # then add some documentation
        docserve
        ```
        
        Basic usage with a custom template:
        
        ```bash
        python -m pip install docserve
        docserve --new # copies sample style and docs into working directory
        docserve # run the server
        ```
        
        ## Roadmap
        
        We are requesting pull-requests for the following features:
        
        * [ ] Find orphans href, embed, img, video, audio
        * [ ] Test cases and CI steps
        * [ ] Add `write-good` CI step.
        * [ ] Clearer heading CSS.  H1 and H2 are confusing.
        * [X] PDF Rendering Plugin using iFrame / embed.
        * [X] Table CSS to include Images.
        * [X] Table CSS to include background and smaller text.
        * [X] Image in li to display:block.
        * [X] Multiple nav entries.
        * [X] Rebuild index as first action to avoid reloading.
        * [X] Checkbox list CSS.
        * [X] V-scroll in nav.
        * [X] Lightbox for images.
        * [ ] Reload on new files.
        * [ ] Better support for missing or no metadata (determine it from the directory structure).
        * [ ] Windows EXE bundle for non-developer use.
        * [ ] Responsive design in default template.
        * [ ] Add support for changing the default Flask host and port.
        * [ ] Generate a large PDF file made from multiple documents (including table of contents with page numbers).
        * [ ] Gravatar print CSS / absent internet in the default theme.
        * [ ] Examples of Python extensions and SCSS extensions.
        * [ ] New template themes.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        If you are running from the script:
        
        ```bash
        python docserve.py                  # start a server on localhost:5000
        
        python docserve.py --html           # freeze the server into a static site as a set of HTML files
                                            # this will exit with -1 if there was a problem parsing any file
        
        python docserve.py --pdf            # generate a set of pdf files for each .md file - won't pull through
                                            # static resource files like with the --html command
        
        python docserve.py --new            # copy default templates and sample docs into the working directory
                                            # and update the config too, only if they don't already exist
        
        python docserve.py --new-force      # copy default templates and sample docs into the working directory
                                            # and update the config too, this will overwrite any existing docs or
                                            # configs.
        
        
        python docserve.py --dirs           # display all the different directories docserve will use to generate
                                            # the documentation
        
        python docserve.py --find-orphans   # display unreferenced media assets in the documentation
        ```
        
        ### Writing Documentation
        
        Documents are managed using `meta-data` at the top of each document.
        Documents can select which `template` they present themselves with.
        Documents must end in **lowercase** `.md`.  For example: `mydocument.md`.
        
        
        ### Environment variables
        
        * `DS_FLASK_DEBUG` flag for enabling or disabling flask debug. Defaults to `TRUE`.
        * `DS_FLASK_CHANGERELOAD` flag for reloading the server when a file changes.  Defaults to `TRUE`. If set, this forces `DS_FLASK_DEBUG` to `TRUE`.
        * `DS_WKHTMLTOPDF` the path to the WkHTMLtoPDF binary. Defaults to `wkhtmltopdf_0.12.5.exe`.
        * `DS_DOCS_DIR` the path to the directory that contains the documents. Defaults to `docs`.
        * `DS_STYLE_DIR` the path to the directory that contains the style templates and resources. Defaults to `style`.
        * `DS_PROJECT_LOGO` the path to the project logo *PNG* file.  Defaults to `logo.png` in the current working directory.
        
        ## Development
        
        ### Virtual Environment
        
        ```python
        python -m virtualenv env
        env/Scripts/activate.bat # or the bash equivalent
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ```python
        python docserve.py # with options
        ```
        
        ```python
        pip install flake8
        flake8 docserve.py --max-line-length=120
        ```
        
        ### WkHTMLtoPDF
        
        To enable PDF output, WkHTMLtoPDF must be set in the config `DS_WKHTMLTOPDF` or `wkhtmltopdf_0.12.5.exe` placed in working directory.
        
        This build uses version 0.12.5. Get it from here: https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
        
        ### SCSS
        
        The default theme is built using SCSS.
        
        The SASSC compiler can be found here: http://libsass.ocbnet.ch/installer/
        Usage: `sassc style/static/default.scss style/static/default.css`
        
        If you want it to auto-watch, run as admin from this directory, and remember to disable your browser cache:
        
        ```bash
        pip install watchdog
        watchmedo shell-command --patterns="*.scss" --recursive --command='echo "${watch_src_path}" && sassc style/static/default.scss style/static/default.css' .
        ````
        
        ### Style
        
        We use `flake8 docserve.py --max-line-length=110` to static check the code.
        
        ### Rebuilding the Package
        
        ```
        python -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel twine
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        
        python -m twine upload dist/*
        ```
