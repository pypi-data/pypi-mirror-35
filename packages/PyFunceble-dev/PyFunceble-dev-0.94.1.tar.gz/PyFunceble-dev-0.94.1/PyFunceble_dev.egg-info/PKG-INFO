        The tool to check domains or IP availability

        PyFunceble is the little sister of
        `Funceble <https://github.com/funilrys/funceble>`__ which was archived
        on 13th March, 2018.
        
        Its main objective is to get and the return domains and IPs availability
        by generating an accurate result based on results from WHOIS, NSLOOKUP
        and HTTP status codes.
        
        PyFunceble is running actively and daily with the help of Travis CI
        under 60+ repositories. It is used to clean or test the availability of
        data which are present in hosts files, list of IP, list of domains,
        blocklists or even AdBlock filter lists.
        
        Indeed, it is possible because PyFunceble generates a list of all
        ``ACTIVE`` domains or IPs but in the same time, it creates by default a
        database of the ``INACTIVE`` domains or IPs so it can retest them
        overtime automatically at the next execution.
