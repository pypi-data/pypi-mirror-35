single.py: A wrapper command to provide an advisory lock, without leaving stale lock files.

Usage: single.py [options] -c command args..
       
Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f LOCK_FILE, --lock-file=LOCK_FILE
                        Path to the lock file. Default is provided based on the command path if omitted.
  -s, --status          Check to see if the file is locked, and if so, by which process. Exit status is 0
                        if unlocked, 1 if locked.

flock(2)'ed file is used to provide locking. This will not leave stale lock files around. 
Note that the existance of lock file does not mean that there is an outstanding lock; 
exclusive flock must be held by a process. 
So use 'single.py --status -f /tmp/foo.lock' to see if the lock is held. 

The OS releases the lock upon process termination, so the lock file is released 
regardless of how the job terminated.

Invocations: 

* single.py -c long-running-scrit arg1 arg2
  will ensure only one long-running-scrit will run at a time.
  Default lock file, specific to the command, is used in the absence of -f option.

* Lockfile can be explicitely specified as:
  single.py -f /tmp/lrs-foo.lock -c long-running-scrit foo
  Two jobs using the same command could be run concurrently by using different lock files, like:
  single.py -f /tmp/lrs-bar.lock -c long-running-scrit bar

* Use --status (-s) option to check if a command or a file is locked:
  single.py -s -f /tmp/foo.lock
  single.py -s -c long-running-scrit 

Example: $ single.py -c sleep 3 & for x in {0..6}; do single.py -s -c sleep; sleep 1; done
