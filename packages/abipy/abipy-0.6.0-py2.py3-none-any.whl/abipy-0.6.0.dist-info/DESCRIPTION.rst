AbiPy is a Python library to analyze the results produced by `ABINIT <https://www.abinit.org>`_,
an open-source program for the ab-initio calculations of the physical properties of materials
within Density Functional Theory and Many-Body perturbation theory.
AbiPy also provides tools to generate input files and workflows to automate
ab-initio calculations and typical convergence studies.
AbiPy is interfaced with `Pymatgen <http://www.pymatgen.org>`_ allowing users to
benefit from the different tools and python objects available in the pymatgen ecosystem.

AbiPy can be used in conjunction with  `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_, `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_,
`ipython <https://ipython.org/index.html>`_ and `jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_
thus providing a powerful and user-friendly environment for data analysis and visualization.
Check out the list of plotting scripts available in our :doc:`gallery </examples/index>`.
