`0.2.0`_ (2018-08-21)
-------------------------------
* trustlines-relay has been released on PyPi
* the dependency on trustlines-contracts has been replaced with a dependency on
  trustlines-contracts-bin. trustlines-contracts-bin contains only the compiled
  contracts. The installation has become easier, since populus and solc isn't
  required anymore. Therefore tl-deploy isn't being installed anymore.

.. _0.2.0: https://github.com/trustlines-network/relay/compare/0.1.0...0.2.0
