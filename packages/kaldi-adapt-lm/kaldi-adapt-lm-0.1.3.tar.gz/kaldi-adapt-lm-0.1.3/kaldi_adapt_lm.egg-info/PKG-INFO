        Adapt Kaldi-ASR nnet3 chain models from Zamia-Speech.org to a different
        language model.

        Tutorial
        --------
        
        To create the language model we would like to adapt our kaldi model to, we first
        need to create a set of sentences. To get started, download and uncompress a generic set
        of sentences for you language, e.g.
        
            wget 'http://goofy.zamia.org/zamia-speech/misc/sentences-en.txt.xz'
            unxz sentences-en.txt.xz
        
        now suppose the file utts.txt contained the sentences you would like the model to
        recognize with a higher probability than the rest. To achieve that, we add these
        sentences five times in this examples to our text body:
        
            cat utts.txt utts.txt utts.txt utts.txt utts.txt sentences-en.txt >lm.txt
        
        we also want to limit our language model to the vocabulary the audio model supports,
        so let's extract the vocabulary next:
        
            MODEL="models/kaldi-generic-en-tdnn_sp-latest"
            cut -f 1 -d ' ' ${MODEL}/data/local/dict/lexicon.txt >vocab.txt
        
        with those files in place we can now train our new language model using KenLM:
        
            lmplz -o 4 --prune 0 1 2 3 --limit_vocab_file vocab.txt --interpolate_unigrams 0 <lm.txt >lm.arpa
        
        Now we can start the kaldi model adaptation process:
        
            kaldi-adapt-lm ${MODEL} lm.arpa mymodel
        
        You should now be able to find a tarball of the resulting model inside the work subdirectory.
