Description: # Sci4All -- scientific toolbox for high school and higher education
        
        Sci4All is a scientific toolbox for high school and higher education.
        
        Sci4All builds on scipy with the aim to deliver simple, expressive and
        intuitive interfaces for various operations, intended to be appropriate for
        interactive use in tools such as Jupyter Notebook. The library aims to offer
        interfaces that are effective and powerful, yet simple to use.
        
        Key objectives of Sci4All are:
        
        - It should be easy to use with a natural and intuitive API, in
          a way that makes it suitable for non-programmers at the high school level.
        
        - It should prepare students for using scientific tools in higher education.
          Interfaces should be kept simple, but not at the expense of over-simplifying
          or "dumbing down" the tools.
        
        - It should build on and provide access to strong lower level scientific
          tools, methodologies and algorithmic programming, within an environment that
          is suitable for continued use by students in further higher education studies
          and academic work
        
        - Though the main target audience for the toolbox is high school students,
          when possible it should aim to design interfaces that are also appropriate
          for use in research and higher education, offering more convenient, intuitive
          or terse access to functionality in libraries that Sci4All builds on.
        
        Sci4All provides friendly, expressive and intuitive interfaces to some
        capabilities of modules such as SciPy and Matplotlib, thus making certain
        scientific functionality of those modules accessible to non-programmers.
        However, the full power of those modules as well as the Python programming are
        still available, allowing students to gradually adopt more advanced use of
        those libraries and as their skills grow.
        
        By offering Sci4All for scientific work at the high school level, our hope
        is that students will have access to a set of tools that are not only
        appropriate for their current educational level, but also provide experience
        with a proper modern programming language (python), enable methodologies and
        work habits appropriate for higher level scientific work, and offer hands-on
        experience with an ecosystem of open source tools that can also serve their
        future needs.
