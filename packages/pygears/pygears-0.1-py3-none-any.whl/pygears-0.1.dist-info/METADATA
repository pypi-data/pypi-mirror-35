Welcome to PyGears
==================

**PyGears** is an ambitious attempt to create a Python framework that facilitates describing digital hardware. It aims to augment current RTL methodology to drastically increase **composability** of hardware modules. Ease of composition leads to better **reusability**, since modules that compose better can be used in a wider variety of contexts. Set of reusable components can then form a well-tested and documented library that significantly speeds up the development process.  

For an introductory **PyGears** example, checkout `echo <https://bogdanvuk.github.io/pygears/echo.html#examples-echo>`_. A snippet is given below: 

.. code-block:: python

  @gear
  def echo(samples: Int, *, fifo_depth, feedback_gain, precision):
      dout = Intf(din.dtype)

      feedback = dout \
          | fifo(depth=fifo_depth, threshold=fifo_depth - 1) \
          | fill_void(fill=Int[16](0)) \
          | decoupler

      feedback_attenuated = (feedback * feedback_gain) >> precision

      dout |= (din + feedback_attenuated) | dout.dtype

      return dout

**PyGears** proposes a single generic interface for all modules (`read about the hardware implementation of the interface here <https://bogdanvuk.github.io/pygears/gears.html#gears-interface>`_) and provides a way to use powerful features of Python language to compose modules written in an existing HDL (currently only supports SystemVerilog). Based on the Python description, **PyGears** generates functionally equivalent, synthesizable RTL code.

Furthermore, **PyGears** offers a way to write verification environment in high-level Python language and co-simulate the generated RTL with an external HDL simulator. **PyGears** features a completely free solution using `Verilator <http://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator>`_ simulator and standard SystemVerilog simulators via the `DPI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog_DPI>`_ (tested on proprietary Questa and NCSim simulators).

**PyGears** also features a `library of standard modules <https://github.com/bogdanvuk/pygears/tree/develop/pygears/common>`_ and the `cookbook library <https://github.com/bogdanvuk/pygears/tree/develop/pygears/cookbook>`_ that are ready to be used in a **PyGears** design.

In **PyGears**, each HDL module is considered a Python function, called the *gear*, hence the design is described in form of a functional (gear) composition. In order for HDL modules to be composable in this way, they need to be designed in accordance with the **Gears** methodology. You should probably `read a short intro to Gears <https://bogdanvuk.github.io/pygears/gears.html#gears-introduction-to-gears>`_ in order to understand this project from the hardware perspective.

**PyGears** supports also the hierarchical gears which do not have a HDL implementation, but are defined in terms of other gears. Each gear accepts and returns interface objects as arguments, which represents module connections. This allows for a module composition to be described in terms of powerful functional concepts, such as: partial application, higher-order functions, function polymorphism.

**PyGears** features a powerful system of `generic types <https://bogdanvuk.github.io/pygears/typing.html#typing>`_, which allows for generic modules to be described, as well as to perform type checking of the gear composition.

Installation
============

Install with ``pip``
--------------------

**PyGears** requires Python3, so check if you need to run ``pip3`` instead of ``pip`` on your distribution. Also consider using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ or `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ to manage your Python version.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pygears

Obtain the examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/bogdanvuk/pygears.git
   cd pygears/examples

Alternative installation from source
------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/bogdanvuk/pygears.git
  cd pygears
  python3 setup.py install

.. warning::

  setup.py might fail to install the necessary dependencies, so you might additionally need to run::

    pip install jinja2

Installing Verilator
--------------------

If you would like to run cosimulations with the Verilator, you need to make sure that it is available on the PATH. You can install it manually by following `these instructions <https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator/wiki/Installing>`_. As an alternative, PyGears offers a script that automatically compiles the latest Verilator. The script was tested on Ubuntu.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install autoconf flex bison
   pygears_tools_install verilator

The script will create ``tools.sh`` bash file that should be sourced prior to running the cosimulation: 

.. code-block:: bash

  source ~/.pygears/tools/tools.sh
