Description: # BeaconTau
        
        A BEACON data analysis package for python3.
        
        This package uses [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) to get the raw c-structs from [the BEACON fork of libnuphase](https://github.com/beaconTau/libnuphase) into python.
        From there all the standard python loveliness is available.
        
        ## Flame (Facility for Live Action Monitoring of Events)
        
        A prototype online browser based event on BeaconTau and bokeh.
        
        ## Version history
        
        I'm aiming to keep [libnuphase](https://github.com/beaconTau/libnuphase) version tags in sync with BeaconTau version tags.
