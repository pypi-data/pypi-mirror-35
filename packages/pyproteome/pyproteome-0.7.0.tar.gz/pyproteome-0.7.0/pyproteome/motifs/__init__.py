"""
This module contains code for phosphorylation motif analysis.

It includes functions for discrete motif enrichment as well as generation of
motif logos. These logos can be generated locally (`logo.make_logo()`) or via
automated hooks to online tools (`plogo.make_logo()`, `weblogo.make_logo()`,
`icelogo.make_logo()`).
