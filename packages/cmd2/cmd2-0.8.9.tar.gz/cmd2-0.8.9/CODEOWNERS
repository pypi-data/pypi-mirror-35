# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Owners of code are automatically nominated to review PRs involving that code.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches javascript files, only these owners
# will be requested to review.
