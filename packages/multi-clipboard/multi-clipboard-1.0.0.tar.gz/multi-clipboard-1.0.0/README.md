# Multi Clipboard
Switch clipboard contents using a simple GUI<br />
Images, text, files and other formats are supported with unlimited amounts of saved clipboards able to be created.<br />
The idea of this is to easily switch clipboards with a simple click in a GUI. It comes with a built in listener for Ctrl + Windows + C

### GUI With Settings Open

## What Is This?
This is my solution to constantly overwriting my clipboard. It is a GUI that acts like a hotbar, click on a virtual clipboard to place it on your actual clipboard. Some command line support has also been added in the form of setting and clearing clipboards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
 - Python (tested on 3.4+)
 - Windows

#### Running the Package From [Source](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/auto-py-to-exe/archive/master.zip)
Don't want to have to install the package? Follow these steps:
1. Clone/download the [repository](https://github.com/brentvollebregt/multi-clipboard)
2. Open cmd/terminal and cd into multi-clipboard using ```cd multi-clipboard```
3. Install requirements using ```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt``` and [install this if pywin32 doesn't install](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases)
4. Run the project using ```python -m multi_clipboard```

#### Installing Via PyPi
*Currently this package is not on PyPi*

### GUI Usage
* Click on clipboard to switch to it (will close automatically on selection by default)
* Right click menu on each clipboard to individually delete/set
* Click on the trash to delete all clipboards
* Click on the plus button to create a new clipboard
* Settings for the GUI can be toggled easily in settings window

### Command Line Usage
* `multi-clipboard` - Opens GUI
* `multi-clipboard -s [clipboard]` - Will load data from that clipboard if it exists
* `multi-clipboard -c *` - Delete all clipboards
* `multi-clipboard -c 1` - Delete clipboard 1
* `multi-clipboard --start-listener` - Starts the listener if it isn't running
* `multi-clipboard --stop-listener` - Stops the listener if it's running
* `multi-clipboard --current` - Check what clipboard you are currently on

## The Listener
This package has a built in listener which listens for Ctrl + Windows + C (Left control). This can be enabled in the GUI's settings under "Toggle Listener" or by arguments as described above. This also comes with a feature to make the listener start on startup. To enable this, go into the GUI's settings and click "Listener Autostart" to toggle it on/off.

## GUI With Settings Open

## So What Happens If...
 - I delete all clipboards? -> Clipboard 0 will be created with the current contents
 - I delete the clipboard I am currently on? -> Nothing, your clipboard will be saved back to that clipboard later.
 - I am shown an error saying my clipboard isn't supported? -> Open up an issue with details on what your clipboard contents are, we can see if it can be supported

## Running From Your Project
If you want to run the GUI from python, first install the package, you can import it and use it:
```python
from multi_clipboard import db, ui
db_manager = db.DatabaseManager()
ui.show_clipboard_selector(db_manager)
```

## Thanks to
* [Michael Robertson](https://github.com/MBRobertson) for adding file support in previous versions.
