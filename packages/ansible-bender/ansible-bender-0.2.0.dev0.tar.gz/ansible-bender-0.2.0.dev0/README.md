# ansible-bender

This is a tool which bends containers using [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)
[playbooks](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html) and turns them into images.
It has a pluggable builder selection â€” it is up to you to pick the tool which
will be used to construct your container image. Right now the only supported
builder is [buildah](https://github.com/projectatomic/buildah). [More to come
in future](#todo-past-010). ansible-bender (ab) relies on [Ansible connection
plugins](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.6/plugins/connection.html) for performing builds.

tl;dr Ansible is the frontend, buildah is the backend.

I described this concept a while ago in [this blog post](https://blog.tomecek.net/post/building-containers-with-buildah-and-ansible/).

You may be asking: why not
[ansible-container](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container)? This tool is
actually heavily inspired by ansible-container: the main distinction is that
ansible-container covers the complete lifecycle of a containerized application
while ab takes care of image builds only.

**Please note that this project is not affiliated with the Ansible project.
It's just using Ansible to do something magical.**


**Status**: proof of concept


## Features:

* You can build your container images with buildah as a backend.
* Ansible playbook is your build recipe.
* You are able to set various image metadata via CLI:
  * working directory
  * environment variables
  * labels
  * user
  * default command
  * exposed ports
* You can do volume mounts during build.


## Installation

`ansible-bender` will be on PyPI starting from version `0.2.0`.

In the meantime, please install it from github directly:
```
$ pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/TomasTomecek/ab@0.1.0
```

Oh right, and ab is tested only with python 3.


## Usage

**Please note that buildah requires root privileges so you need to invoke ab as root.**

You may noticed that I refer to `ansible-bender` as ab. That was the initial
name and also the name of the CLI tool, so I decided to stick to it.

Right now, ab has just a single command and that is... `build`:
```
$ ab build -e SOME=VALUE -l some=other-value -- ./tests/functional/data/basic_playbook.yaml docker.io/library/python:3-alpine this-is-my-image

Image 'this-is-my-image' was built successfully \o/
```

The command line is a bit longer. That's because all metadata about our target image is in there:
```
$ ab build                                       \  # this is the command
     -e SOME=VALUE                               \  # -e sets environment variables
     -l some=other-value                         \  # -l sets labels
     --                                          \  # two dashes separate options from arguments
     ./tests/functional/data/basic_playbook.yaml \  # first argument is a path to a playbook
     docker.io/library/python:3-alpine           \  # second one is a base image (and is pulled if it's not present)
     this-is-my-image                            \  # and finally, target image name
```

Here is a proof that the image is in there:
```
$ podman images this-is-my-image
REPOSITORY                   TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
localhost/this-is-my-image   latest   7558393975c7   1 minute ago   84.4MB
```


## TODO past 0.1.0

* [ ] Explicit layering
* [ ] Explicit caching
* [ ] A fancy name!
* [ ] You can build images with podman (needs Ansible connection plugin for podman)
* [ ] You can build images with docker (incubator maybe?)
