Description:  You can use this project to create new modules quickly. The process for creating a new module is to simply fork this project, rename the *project_module* package, change it's content to and explain your project by replacing any current documentation.  TODO: This docstring should be in standard PEP8 style, with a short description of the module on the first line as seen above. The short line should be followed by a long-form description of your module similar to the one which you are currently reading.
