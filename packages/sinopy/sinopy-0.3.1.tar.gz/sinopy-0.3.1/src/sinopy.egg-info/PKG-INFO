        SinoPy is an attempt to provide useful functionality for users working with Chinese dialects and Sino-Tibetan language data and struggling with tasks like converting characters to Pinyin, analysing characters, or analysing readings in Chinese dialects and other SEA languages.

        This is intended as a plugin for LingPy, or an addon. The library gives utility functions that prove useful to handle Chinese data in a very broad context, ranging from Chinese character readings up to proposed readings in Middle Chinese and older stages of the language.
        
        ## Quick Usage Examples
        
        Convert Baxter's (1992) Middle Chinese transcription system to plain IPA (with tone marks).
        
        ```python
        >>> from sinopy import baxter2ipa
        >>> baxter2ipa('bjang')
        'bjaŋ¹'
        >>> baxter2ipa('bjang', segmented=True)
        ['b', 'j', 'a', 'ŋ', '¹']
        ```
        
        Convert Chinese characters to Pīnyīn
        
        ```python
        >>> from sinopy import pinyin
        >>> pinyin('我', variant='cantonese')
        'ngo5'
        >>> pinyin('我', variant='mandarin')
        'wǒ'
        ```
        
        Try to find character by combining two characters:
        
        ```python
        >>> from sinopy import character_from_structure
        >>> character_from_structure('+人我')
        '俄'
        ```
