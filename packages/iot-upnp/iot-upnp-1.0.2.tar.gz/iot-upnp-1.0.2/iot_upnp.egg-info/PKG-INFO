        This project is a little pure Python library to annonce a device by
        UPnP. It’s made for IoT developers to let them show their device on
        network discovery in any OS.
        
        With IoT-UPnP, you can show your device on all computers with Windows
        Explorer (network discovery). Users can doucle-click on the device to
        open the device configuration page. The device will be shown without any
        software installation on user’s computers.
        
        Developers can use UPnP to announce custom services and let others
        applications use these services. For example, if cameras announce a
        service “exemple-org:service:camera-image”, you can made a software
        witch easy discover all cameras with this service.
