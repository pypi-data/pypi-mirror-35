From sources
------------

At this point this is the main method of obtaining MicroInverse. 
PyPi release will be available once the code is in shape for that.

The sources for MicroInverse can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/AleksiNummelin/MicroInverse

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/AleksiNummelin/MicroInverse/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Github repo: https://github.com/AleksiNummelin/MicroInverse
.. _tarball: https://github.com/AleksiNummelin/MicroInverse/tarball/master

Stable release
--------------

At present MicroInverse is still at its development phase and not hosted by PyPi. 
Once it will be available you can install MicroInverse, by running this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install MicroInverse

.. This is the preferred method to install MicroInverse, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
