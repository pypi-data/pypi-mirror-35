        Angry Metal Guy Player (AMG Player) is a Python multi platform console
        tool to automatically play or download tracks from `Angry Metal
        Guy <https://www.angrymetalguy.com/>`__ reviews.
        
        I created this because:
        
        -  I like Angry Metal Guy, and discovered great music (both metal and
           totally non-metal) thanks to their reviews
        -  I often disagree with their ratings (in fact I disagree more often
           than I agree), both for overrating and underrating
        -  Even when I disagree, I like reading their reviews
        -  I want to listen to the music **before** I read the review, to avoid
           getting influenced
        -  To be efficient, I want to listen to the tracks like a radio, and
           read the review to learn more only when I like something
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Can work either in interactive mode (manually select tracks) or
           totally automatic (play new tracks like a radio)
        -  Supports embedded tracks from: YouTube, Bandcamp, SoundCloud,
           ReverbNation
        -  Plays YouTube video if available, or generates a video on the fly
           with the cover image + audio track(s) (requires FFmpeg)
        -  Can download tracks (with embedded album art) to play later
