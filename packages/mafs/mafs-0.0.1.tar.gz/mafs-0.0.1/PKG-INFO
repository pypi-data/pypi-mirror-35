Description: # MagicFS (mafs)
        
        MagicFS is a simple-to-use tool that allows you to easily create virtual
        filesystems using FUSE.
        
        If you've ever wanted to play around with filesystems, but have been put off by
        the complexity of libfuse, this library could be for you. You can easily create
        whole, feature-complete filesystems in just a few lines of code. No need for
        painstakingly dealing with folder structures and buffers, mafs manages all the
        low-level details, provides sane defaults, and lets you focus on functionality.
        
        ## Installation
        
        	$ git clone https://github.com/jedevc/mafs.git
        	$ cd mafs
        	$ pip install .
        
        ## Examples
        
        All of the examples are listed in `examples/`. Here's a demo of running the
        `places.py` example.
        
        	$ mkdir fs
        	$ python3 examples/places.py fs
        	$ ls fs
        	place  shortcut
        	$ ls fs/place
        	here  there
        	$ cat fs/place/here
        	this is here
        	$ cat fs/place/there
        	this is there
        	$ cat fs/place/anywhere
        	this is anywhere!
        	$ fusermount -u fs
