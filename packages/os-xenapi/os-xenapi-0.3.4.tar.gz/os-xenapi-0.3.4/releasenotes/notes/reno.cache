        \ save them into a json file which can be used\n  as input for other OpenStack\

    features: ['The os-xenapi library now supports the VDI streaming feature which
        will

        allow the library user to create XenServer VDI from a gzipped image data

        stream; or create gzipped image data stream from a specified XenServer

        VDI.


        By comparing to the existing dom0 glance plugin, the image data gets

        processed on the fly via streams. So it doesn''t create intermediate files.

        And it completely uses the formal VDI import or export APIs when it

        exchanges VDI data with XenServer.

        hosts which belong to a XAPI pool, so that we can get the benefits from

        without moving the disks on shared storage.
