        =======================
        
        The purpose of this package is *not* to provide new functionality
        but to factor out existing functionality from an existing monolitic Zope product.
        Thus, it is more likely to loose functionality during further development
        (as parts of it will be - or have already been - forked out into their own packages,
        or some functionality may even become obsolete because there are better
        alternatives in standard Plone components).
        
        It is currently not expected to be useful to a broader audience;
        many "browsers" implemented here are very specific to our sites like they exist
        now.
