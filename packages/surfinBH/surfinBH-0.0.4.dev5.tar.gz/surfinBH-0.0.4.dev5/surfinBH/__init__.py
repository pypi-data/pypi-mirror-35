Surrogate Final BH properties.

Example usage
-------------

To evaluate fits for remnant mass, spin and kick velocity of nonprecessing
binary black hole systems as presented in Varma:2018_in_prep.

import surfinBH

# First load the model
fit_3dq8 = surfinBH.LoadFits('3dq8')

# Mass ratio and component spins along orbital angular momentum direction
q = 6.7
chi1z = 0.74
chi2z = -0.6
x = [q, chi1z, chi2z]

## Evaluate the fits and GPR error estimate.

# Final mass
mC, mC_err_est = fit_3dq8('mC', x)

# Final spin along orbital angular momentum direction
chiCz, chiCz_err_est = fit_3dq8('chiC', x)

# Final kick velocity (velCz is zero for nonprecessing systems)
velC, velC_err_est = fit_3dq8('velC', x)
velCx, velCy = velC
velCx_err_est, velCy_err_est = velC_err_est

Additional examples can be found in the accompanying ipython notebooks.
