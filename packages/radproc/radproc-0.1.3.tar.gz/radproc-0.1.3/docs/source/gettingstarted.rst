System requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To be able to use all features offered by radproc, you need...

* a 64-Bit operating system (32-Bit systems can not allocate more than 3 GB memory, which is not sufficient for radar data processing)
* Python version 2.7 (64-Bit). It is strongly recommended to use the Anaconda distribution since this already includes all needed scientific site-packages.
* ArcMap version 10.4 or newer
* ArcGIS 64-Bit background processing
* for processing of RADOLAN data in 5-minute resolution at least 16 GB RAM are recommended

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, install ArcMap for Desktop and its extension 64-Bit background processing.

Next, download and install the latest Anaconda distribution from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ (Windows, 64-Bit, Python version 2.7).

radproc is currently distributed as wheel file for Python version 2.7 on Windows operating systems (64-Bit only!).
You can download the radproc wheel from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/jkreklow/radproc/tree/0.1.0/dist

To install radproc using Anaconda and pip...

1. Open the Windows terminal by typing CMD into the Windows search (Administrator rights may be necessary!).
2. Type::

	pip install C:\path\to\wheelfile\radproc_wheel.whl

   Now radproc is automatically installed into your Anaconda root environment.
   You can check by opening Spyder or Jupyter Notebook and entering::

	import radproc
	
3. To enable your Anaconda distribution to "see" the arcpy package from your separate ArcGIS Python installation,
   you need to **copy the Path file DTBGGP64.pth** which is usually located at *C:\\Python27\\ArcGISx6410.4\\Lib\\site-packages*
   into the corresponding site-packages folder of your Anaconda distribution, e.g. *C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda2\\Lib\\site-packages*

   To check if arcpy is now visible for Anaconda, import arcpy to Spyder or Jupyter Notebook::

	import arcpy
