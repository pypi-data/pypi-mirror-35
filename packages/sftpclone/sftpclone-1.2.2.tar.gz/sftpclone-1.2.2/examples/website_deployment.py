"""
sftpclone can be imported into a custom Python script to deploy a static website
to a web host where you only have stripped-down sftp access.

The below is an example of a deployment script that keeps
your username and password out of the shell history and uses an exclude file.

In practice, one might have complex needs.
For example, the website may be built from assets in multiple, separately managed directory trees on the local host.
Using sftpclone programmatically with exclude files makes it easy to script one-step deployments for such situations.
