Description: Asynker: Coroutine scheduler for the "await" syntax
        ===================================================
        
        Asynker (IPA: /eɪˈsɪŋkɜːn/) is pretty much the least amount of code you need
        to use the "await" syntax. Typically packages like asyncio or curio implement
        two concepts at once: a scheduler and an event loop. The scheduler is a piece
        of code that decides what to run next and then runs it. The event loop is
        a piece of code that tells the scheduler what it *can* run.
        
        Asynker only provides the scheduling part. This generally only makes sense if
        you are using something else as the event loop, e.g. something callback-based.
        Asynker allows you to use a callback-based system and easily convert it into
        a coroutine/await-based system.
        
        The Future class used in Asynker is unrelated to any of the various Future
        classes found in the Python standard library (for now, anyway).
