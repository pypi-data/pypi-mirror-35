This package provides the *policy* for MCL, the Molecular and Cellular
Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions.  As such, it orchestrates
dependiencies, codifies characteristics, and systematizes settings to
make the Zope_ application server and the Plone_ content management
system into the MCL website.
