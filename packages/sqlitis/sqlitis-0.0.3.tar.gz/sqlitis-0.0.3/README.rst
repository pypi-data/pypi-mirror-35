=========
 sqlitis
=========

This is a tool to convert plain SQL queries to SQLAlchemy expressions. It is usable from the command line or as a library.

This converts to the `SQLAlchemy expression language`_. It does not support the SQLAlchemy ORM.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install sqlitis

Examples
--------

Turning a select query into a sqlachemy expression:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sqlitis 'select foo.name, bar.value from foo join bar'
    select([foo.c.name, bar.c.value]).select_from(foo.join(bar))


Converting a join:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sqlitis 'foo join bar on foo.id = bar.foo_id and (foo.val < 100 or bar.val < 100)'
    foo.join(bar, and_(foo.c.id == bar.c.foo_id, or_(foo.c.val < 100, bar.c.val < 100)))

Running tests
-------------

This repository includes a data-driven test suite as well as style checks (with `flake8`_) and automatic code formatting (with `yapf`_).

Use tox to run the tests.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install tox
    ### Run everything
    $ tox
    ### Run just the unit/functional tests
    $ tox -e py27
    ### Run just style/formatting checks
    $ tox -e flake8

`yapf`_ is used to automatically fix code style/formatting errors. It will reformat your code in place.

.. code-block:: bash

    ### Auto-fix style/formatting checks
    $ tox -e yapf

There are three types of tests:

- Unit tests of the internal models
- Unit tests of the core `to_sqla` function
- Functional tests that execute the generated SQLAlchemy expressions, against a sqlite database.

Most of these tests are generated from data in ``tests/data.json``.
