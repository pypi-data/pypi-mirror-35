        xmldiff is a library and a command line utility for making diffs out of
        XML.
        
        xmldiff 2.0 is a complete, ground up pure-Python rewrite of xmldiff 1.x.
        xmldiff 2.x had various problems, mainly that the code is complex and
        unpythonic, making it hard to maintain and fix bugs, there is also an
        infinite loop in certain cases, and the c implementation leaks memory,
        as well as being hard to use as a library.
        
        xmldiff 2.0 is currently significantly slower than xmldiff 2.x, but this may
        change in the future. Currently we make no effort to make xmldiff 2.0 fast,
        we concentrate on making it correct and usable.
        
        xmldiff aims to have 100% test coverage.
        Python 2.7 support will be dropped soon.
        
        The diff algorithm is based on "`Change Detection in Hierarchically Structured Information
        <http://ilpubs.stanford.edu/115/1/1995-46.pdf>`_",
        and the text diff is using Googles diff_match_patch algorithm.

        Quick usage
        -----------
        
        From the commandline::
        
          $ xmldiff file1.xml file2.xml
        
        As a library::
        
          from lxml import etree
          from xmldiff import main, formatting
        
          differ = diff.Differ()
          diff = main.diff_files('file1.xml', 'file2.xml',
                                 formatter=formatting.XMLFormatter())
        
          print(diff)
        
        There is also a method ``diff_trees()`` that take two lxml trees, and
        a method ``diff_texts()`` that will take strings containing XML.
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        2.0b1 (2018-09-03)
        ------------------
        
        - A complete, bottom-up, pure-python rewrite
        
        - New output formats:
        
          - A list of actions (similar but not compatible with the old format)
        
          - XML with changes marked though tags and attributes
        
          - RML aware XML where tags containing text are semantically diffed, useful
            for human output such as converting to HTML or PDF
