Description: Populous - *populate your database with god-like powers*
        ========================================================
        
        Populous is a tool for fast and rich data generation. From a description
        of your schema say how many objects you want, what they should look
        like, and populous will create them for you!
        
        Current state
        -------------
        
        The project is in a very early stage and proof-of-concept state. Please
        be patient, but don't hesitate to share your thoughts and desires with
        us in the issues.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        **Sorry, but the documentation is not ready yet :( .**
        
        However, if you are very eager to try it, here is what you can do:
        
        -  Install populous: ``pip install populous``
        -  Have a PostgreSQL database at hand
        -  Find some blueprints (YAML files describing what you want to
           generate) or create some. This is the tricky part, but you can find
           some examples in the ``demo/blueprints/`` directory.
        -  Launch populous with those blueprints:
           ``populous run postgres demo/blueprints/*.yml`` (you can pass your
           postgres instance either via ``PG*`` environment variables or via
           arguments)
        -  Gaze at your freshly generated data via ``psql`` or any other tool!
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        OSX compilation problems
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        There's currently no pre-compiled package for the
        ``peloton_bloomfilters`` library, which is a current requirement for
        populous. To correctly install it in your environment, you're going to:
        
        -  install ``gcc`` (via homebrew, for example),
        -  install the package using the following flags
           ``ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" CC=/usr/bin/gcc``.
        
        For example, to install locally:
        
        ::
        
            ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" CC=/usr/bin/gcc pip install peloton_bloomfilters
        
        Or if you want to run the test suite via tox:
        
        ::
        
            ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" CC=/usr/bin/gcc tox
