timeseriescv
------------

This package implements two cross-validation algorithms suitable to evaluate machine learning models based on time series
datasets where each sample is tagged with a prediction time and an evaluation time.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

timeseriescv can be installed using pip:

    >>> pip install timeseriescv

For now the package contains two main classes handling cross-validation:

* ``PurgedWalkForwardCV``: Walk-forward cross-validation with purging.
* ``CombPurgedKFoldCV``: Combinatorial cross-validation with purging and embargoing.

Remarks concerning the API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API is as similar to the scikit-learn API as possible. Like the scikit-learn cross-validation classes, the ``split``
method is a generator that yields a pair of numpy arrays containing the positional indices of the samples in the train
and validation set, respectively. The main differences with the scikit-learn API are:

* The ``split`` method takes as arguments not only the predictor values ``X``, but also the prediction times ``pred_times`` and the evaluation times ``eval_times`` of each sample.
* To stay as close to the scikit-learn API as possible, this data is passed as separate parameters. But in order to ensure that they are properly aligned, ``X``, ``pred_times`` and ``eval_times`` are required to be pandas DataFrames/Series sharing the same index.

Check the docstrings of the cross-validation classes for more information.
