Description: stream\_monitor
        ===============
        
        This program monitors a specified set of data streams (files) for
        changes. If a file is not changed in a specified time, an alert is sent
        using `scalar <https://github.com/wdbm/scalar>`__.
        
        setup
        =====
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install stream_monitor
        
        Set up scalar, as described `here <https://github.com/wdbm/scalar>`__.
        
        configuration and usage
        =======================
        
        A JSON configuration file (by default
        ``stream_monitor_configuration.json``) guides the program on the streams
        to monitor and their required update times. Its contents are of the
        following form:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            {
                "streams": {
                    "./recording.csv": {"update_time"}: 30
                }
            }
        
        In this example configuration, ``recording.csv`` is a filepath to
        monitor for changes and ``30`` is the time in seconds within which the
        filepath should change.
        
        When the program ``stream_monitor`` is executed, it imports the
        configuration and runs in a continuous loop, sending an alert whenever
        it detects that a stream is not being updated in its expected update
        time. The script has options for the configuration filepath, alarms,
        checking interval and verbosity (see ``stream_monitor --help``).
