Description: 
        Widgets for quickly visualizing pandas dataframes
        
        It is often necessary to plot data in order to understand it. Plotting
        allows to quiclky spot glitches in the data: that person who is 180 meters
        tall or this car which can speed thousands of kilometers per hour will
        immediately stand out. In this situation, one wants a way to quickly
        (rather than beautifully) plot their data. Quickviz provides a set of
        widgets to do this in a few clicks.
