Description: 
        This package provides widgets for quickly visualizing pandas dataframes
        
        It is often necessary to plot data in order to understand it. It allows to
        quiclky spot glitches: that person who is 180 meters tall, this car which
        can speed thousands of kilometers per hour. In this situation, one needs a
        way to quickly (rather than beautifully) plot what is there. This package
        provides a set of widgets to do this very quickly in a few clicks. It
        targets speed and ease of use over completeness of the api.
