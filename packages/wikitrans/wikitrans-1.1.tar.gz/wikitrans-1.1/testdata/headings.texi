@section Section headings
@node Section headings

@i{Headings} organize your writing into
sections. The Wiki software can automatically
generate a @ref{table of contents} from them.

@subsection Subsection
@node Subsection

Using more "equals" (=) signs creates a subsection.

@subsubsection A smaller subsection
@node A smaller subsection

Don't skip levels,
like from two to four equals signs.

Start with 2 equals signs not 1
because 1 creates H1 tags
which should be reserved for page title.
