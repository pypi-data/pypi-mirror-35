luddite
=======

``luddite`` checks if pinned versions in your ``requirements.txt`` file have newer versions in the package index. It's great to be near the cutting edge, but not so close that you get cut! This tool will help you keep things up to date manually.

There are `many ways to specify requirements <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format>`_ in those files, but luddite's parsing is pretty dumb and simple: we're only looking for ``package==version`` pins. It won't break on lines that aren't fitting this format, but you'll have to check them manually.

``luddite`` works on both Python 2 and Python 3.


Installation
------------

``pip install luddite``


Usage
-----

``luddite /path/to/requirements.txt``

If you are in the same directory as the ``requirements.txt`` file, you can just type ``luddite``.
