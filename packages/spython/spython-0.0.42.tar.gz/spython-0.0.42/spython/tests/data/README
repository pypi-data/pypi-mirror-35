# Generation

The cirros and busybox images were produced with Singularity 2.4, which has a much smaller image footprint. The file extractions for the package are from 2016, and were remade as one had become corrupt. More evidence for squashfs

Singularity Python version 1.2.1 with Singularity Version 2.4
