Hi, I'm Tim Bielawa, the bitmath maintainer. Would you like to get in
touch? Maybe you want to peek at other stuff I'm working on? Go right
ahead:

**Blog**
 I maintain a blog which mostly covers technical problems I encounter
 that I think are interesting and how I solved them. Lots of rich
 commentary and details included!

 * `Technitribe <https://blog.lnx.cx>`_

**Open Source**
 Almost every project I work on, code or not, ends up on GitHub
 eventually. You can see what else I've been busy with on my profile.

 * `GitHub: tbielawa <https://github.com/tbielawa/>`_

**Tweet-Tweet**
 I have been known to tweet from time to time.

 * `@tbielawa <https://twitter.com/tbielawa>`_


**Bugs/Issues/Requests**
 All contributions related directly to the bitmath project, i.e. bug
 reports or feature requests, should be posted to the project issue
 tracker on GitHub. Please see the Contributing section for more
 information.

 * :ref:`Contributing <contributing>`

**Saying hello**
 I'm on the `freenode <https://freenode.net/>`_ IRC network Monday
 through Friday, from around 9am EST through 5pm EST.

 * Issue a ``/who tbielawa*`` command to the server, a handle with the
   netmask ``~tbielawa@redhat/tbielawa`` will appear for you to
   ``/query`` if I'm online.

**E-Mail**
 If you want to contact me directly, `clone the project
 <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath>`_ and look at any of `my
 bitmath commits
 <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/commits/master?author=tbielawa>`_
 to find my email address.
