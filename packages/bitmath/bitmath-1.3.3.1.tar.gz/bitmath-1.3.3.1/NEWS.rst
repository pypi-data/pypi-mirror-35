`bitmath-1.3.3-1
<https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/releases/tag/1.3.3.1>`__ was
published on 2018-08-23.


Project
=======

Version 1.3.3 is a minor update primarily released to synchronize
versions across platforms. Additionally there are small packaging
updates to keep up with changing standards.

Minor bug fixes and documentation tweaks are included as well.

The project now has an official `Code of Conduct
<https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_,
as well as issue and pull request templates.


What happened to bitmath 1.3.2? It only ever existed as an idea in
source control.

<https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/releases/tag/1.3.1.1>`__ was
published on 2016-07-17.

Changes
=======

**Added Functionality**

* New function: :func:`bitmath.parse_string_unsafe`, a less strict
  version of :func:`bitmath.parse_string`. Accepts inputs using
  *non-standard* prefix units (such as single-letter, or
  mis-capitalized units).

* Inspired by `@darkblaze69 <https://github.com/darkblaze69>`_'s
  request in `#60 "Problems in parse_string"
  <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/issues/60>`_.


Project
=======

**Ubuntu**

* Bitmath is now available for installation via Ubuntu Xenial, Wily,
  Vivid, Trusty, and Precise PPAs.

* Ubuntu builds inspired by `@hkraal <https://github.com/hkraal>`_
  reporting an `installation issue
  <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/issues/57>`_ on Ubuntu systems.


**Documentation**

* `Cleaned up a lot <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/issues/59>`_
  of broken or re-directing links using output from the Sphinx ``make
  linkcheck`` command.

  based units. Enhancement requested in `#53 parse french unit names
  <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/issues/53>`_ by `walidsa3d
  <https://github.com/walidsa3d>`_.

**Bug Fixes**

  library in RPM packages.


Project
=======

**Fedora/EPEL**

Look for separate python3.x and python2.x packages coming soon to
`Fedora <https://getfedora.org/>`_ and `EPEL
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_. This is happening because of
the `initiative
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Python_3_Porting_2015>`_ to update
the base Python implementation on Fedora to Python 3.x
