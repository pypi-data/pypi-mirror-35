Description: # bobskater
        
        An AST based Python obfuscator that robustly mangles names and other obfuscations of Python code
        
        ### Current limitations:
        * DOES NOT SUPPORT: Annotations, evals, templated strings, imports of the form import xxx.yyy
        * Very little configuration currently and instead takes a cautious approach in determining what identifiers to mangle. Globals, kwargs, class namespace identifiers, and others are not obfuscated but type of obfuscations should be use selected in the future.
        * It is only tested with Python v3.5 and might not work with other AST versions
        * Scoping for comprehensions are kind of hacky (and basically follows Python 2 comprehension scope leaking methodology)
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```
        pip install bobskater
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        `bobskater` provides a few mechanisms for direct use.
        
        * `obfuscateString("")` obfuscates a string of source code.
        * `obfuscateFile('myfile.py')` will obfuscate an entire file and overwrite the original
        
        Both take keyword arguments for configuration:
        
        * `removeDocstrings` will remove docstrings by replacing them with `pass` statements (to handle even cases where a function has only a docstring). Defaults to `True`
        * `obfuscateNames` will obfuscate all names except globally scoped variables, kwargs, builtins, and identifiers in a class namespace. Defaults to `True`
        
        There are no other obfuscations performed than the two mentioned above currently in `bobskater`
        
        #### Example
        
        ```
        from bobskater import obfuscateString
        
        myFileContents = open('myfile.py', 'r').read()
        
        #Will obfuscate myFileContents and return it into output. Names will not be mangled, only docstrings will be removed
        output = obfuscateString(myFileContents, obfuscateNames=False)
        ```
