Description: 
        =====================================
        django-uni-form (django-uni-form)
        =====================================
        
        Django_ forms are easily rendered as tables,
        paragraphs, and unordered lists. However, elegantly rendered div based forms
        is something you have to do by hand. The purpose of this application is to
        provide a simple tag and/or filter that lets you quickly render forms in a div
        format.
        
        `Uni-form`_ has been selected as the base model for the design of the forms.

        .. note:: django-uni-form only supports Django 1.2 or higher and Python
        2.5.4, Python 2.6.x and Python 2.7.x. If you need to support earlier versions
        of Django or Python you will need to use django-uni-form 0.7.0.
