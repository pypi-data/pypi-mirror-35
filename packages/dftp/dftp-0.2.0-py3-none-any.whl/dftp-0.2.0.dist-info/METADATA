# Don't Forget the Python

Don't Forget the Python is a command-line interface for [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com), an online task-management system.

Remember the Milk is very good at what it does - and is very easy to use in the browser and various apps - so Don't Forget the Python does not focus on duplicating its abilities, but instead adds a couple features that RTM doesn't currently provide, like exporting your tasks to pdf and printing your lists and tasks to the terminal. Currently, only a simplified version of tasks is supported (name and due or completed date), but more verbose capabilities are in development.

## Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of pip installed:

`pip3 install --upgrade pip` (or just `pip install --upgrade pip` if you are working from a python3 virtual environment or only have python3 installed.)

`pip install dftp`

## Usage

From a terminal, run `dftp` and the list of available commands will be shown.

## New in Version 0.2.0

You can now filter tasks by various due and/or completed dates - on, before, or after a date (and between two dates). Run `dftp tasks --help` in a terminal to see the options.

## Disclaimer

This CLI uses the Remember The Milk API but is not endorsed or certified by Remember The Milk.
