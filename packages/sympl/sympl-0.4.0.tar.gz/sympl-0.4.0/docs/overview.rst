Overview: Why Sympl?
====================

Traditional atmospheric and Earth system models can be difficult to understand
and modify for a number of reasons. Sympl aims to learn from the past
experience of these models to accelerate research and improve accessibility.

Sympl defines a framework of Python object APIs that can be combined to create a
model. This has a number of benefits:

* Objects can use code written in any language that can be called from Python,
  including Fortran, C, C++, Julia, Matlab, and others.
* Each object, such as a radiation parameterization, has a clearly documented
  interface and can be understood without looking at any other part of a
  model's code. Certain interfaces have been designed to force model code to
  self-document, such as having inputs and outputs as properties of a scheme.
* Objects can be swapped out with other compatible objects. For example, Sympl
  makes it trivial to change the type of time stepping used.
* Code can be re-used between different types of models. For instance, an
  atmospheric general circulation model, numerical weather prediction model,
  and large-eddy simulation could all use the same RRTM radiation object.
* Already-existing documentation for Sympl can tell your users how to configure
  and run your model. You will likely spend less time writing documentation,
  but end up with a better documented model. As long as you write docstrings,
  you're good to go!

Sympl also contains a number of commonly used objects, such
as time steppers and NetCDF output objects.

So is Sympl a model?
--------------------

Sympl is *not* a model itself. In particular, physical parameterizations and
dynamical cores are not present in Sympl. This code instead can be found in
other projects that make use of Sympl.

Sympl is meant to be a community ecosystem that allows researchers and other
users to use and combine components from a number of different sources.
By keeping model physics/dynamics code outside of Sympl itself, researchers
can own and maintain their own models. The framework API ensures that models
using Sympl are clear and accessible, and allows components from different models
and packages to be used alongside one another.

Then where's the model?
-----------------------

Check out `CliMT <https://github.com/climt/climt>`_ as an example.

Models created with Sympl can work differently from traditional Fortran models.
A model developer makes the components of their model available. Using these
components, you can write a script which acts as the model executable, but also
configures the model, and calls any online analysis you want to run. Model
developers may make example model scripts available which you can modify.

In a way, when you configure the model you are writing the model itself. This
is reasonable in Sympl because the model run script should be accessible and
readable by users with basic knowledge of programming (even users who don't
know Python). By being readable, the model run script tells others clearly and
precisely how you configured and ran your model.

The API
-------

In a Sympl model, the model
state is contained within a "state dictionary". This is a Python dictionary
whose keys are strings indicating a quantity, and values are DataArrays with
the values of those quantities. The one exception is "time", which is stored
as a timedelta or datetime-like object, not as a DataArray. The DataArrays
also contain information about the units of the quantity, and the grid it is
located on. At the start of a model script, the state dictionary should be
set to initial values. Code to do this may be present in other packages, or you
can write this code yourself. The state and its initialization is discussed
further in :ref:`Model State`.

The state dictionary is evolved by :py:class:`~sympl.TendencyStepper` and
:py:class:`~sympl.Stepper` objects. These types of objects take in the state
and a timedelta object that indicates the time step, and return the next
model state. :py:class:`~sympl.TendencyStepper` objects do this by wrapping
:py:class:`~sympl.TendencyComponent` objects, which calculate tendencies using the
state dictionary. We should note that the meaning of "Stepper" in Sympl is
slightly different than its traditional definition. Here an "Stepper" object is
one that calculates the new state directly from the current state, or any
object that requires the timestep to calculate the new state, while
"TendencyComponent" objects are ones that calculate tendencies without using the
timestep. If a :py:class:`~sympl.TendencyStepper` or :py:class:`~sympl.Stepper`
object needs to use multiple time steps in its calculation, it does so by
storing states it was previously given until they are no longer needed.

The state is also calculated using :py:class:`~sympl.DiagnosticComponent` objects which
determine diagnostic quantities at the current time from the current state,
returning them in a new dictionary. This type of object is particularly useful
if you want to write your own online diagnostics.

The state can be stored or viewed using :py:class:`~sympl.Monitor` objects.
These take in the model state and do something with it, such as storing it in
a NetCDF file, or updating an interactive plot that is being shown to the user.
