        Lyrics Displayer
        ----------------
        
        Lyrics Displayer automatically detects what song is playing on a
        music player connected to the same network.
        
        It then queries lyrics from various online sources and displays
        the lyrics to the command line (attempting to estimate the current
        position in the song).
