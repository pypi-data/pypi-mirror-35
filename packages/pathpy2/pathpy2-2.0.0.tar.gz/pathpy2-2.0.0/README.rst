Introduction
============

``pathpy`` is an OpenSource python package for the analysis of time
series data on networks using **higher-order** and **multi-order**
graphical models.

The package is specifically tailored to analyze temporal networks as
well as sequential data that capture multiple short, independent paths
observed in an underlying graph topology. Examples for data that can be
analysed with ``pathpy`` include time-stamped social networks, user
click streams in information networks, biological pathways, or traces of
information propagating in social media. Unifying the analysis of
pathways and temporal networks, ``pathpy`` provides various methods to
extract time-respecting paths from time-stamped network data. It extends
(and will eventually supersede) the package
```pyTempnets`` <https://github.com/IngoScholtes/pyTempNets>`__.

``pathpy`` facilitates the analysis of temporal correlations in time
series data on networks. It uses a principled model selection technique
to infer higher-order graphical representations that capture both
topological and temporal characteristics. It specifically allows to
answer the question when a network abstraction of time series data is
justified and when higher-order network representations are needed.

The theoretical foundation of this package, **higher-order network
models**, was developed in the following research works:

``pathpy`` extends this approach towards **multi-layer graphical
models** that capture temporal correlations at multiple length scales
simultaneously. An illustrative example for a collection of paths (left)
and a multi-order graphical representation is shown below. All
mathematical details of the framework can be found in this `recent
research paper <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3098145>`__.

Download and installation
=========================

``pathpy`` is pure python code. It has no platform-specific dependencies
and should thus work on all platforms. It builds on ``numpy`` and
``scipy``. The latest version of ``pathpy`` can be installed by typing:

``> pip install git+git://github.com/IngoScholtes/pathpy.git``

Tutorial
========

A `comprehensive educational
tutorial <https://ingoscholtes.github.io/pathpy/tutorial.html>`__ which
shows how you can use ``pathpy`` to analyze data on pathways and
temporal networks is `available
online <https://ingoscholtes.github.io/pathpy/tutorial.html>`__.
Moreover, a tutorial which illustrates the abstraction of **higher-order
networks** in the modeling of dynamical processes in temporal networks
is `available
here <https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/people/ischoltes/research-insights/temporal-networks-demo/>`__.
The latter tutorial is based on the predecessor library
```pyTempNets`` <https://github.com/IngoScholtes/pyTempNets>`__. Most of
its features have been ported to ``pathpy``.

Documentation
=============

The code is fully documented via docstrings which are accessible through
python's built-in help system. Just type ``help(SYMBOL_NAME)`` to see
the documentation of a class or method. A `reference manual is available
here <https://ingoscholtes.github.io/pathpy/hierarchy.html>`__.

Releases and Versioning
=======================

The first public beta release of pathpy (released February 17 2017) is
`v1.0-beta <https://github.com/IngoScholtes/pathpy/releases/tag/v1.0-beta.1>`__.
Following versions are named MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH according to `semantic
versioning <http://semver.org/>`__. The date of each release is encoded
in the PATCH version.
