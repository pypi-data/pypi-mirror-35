        A zero boilerplate neopixel control library for the Raspberry Pi
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        PixelZero can be downloaded to your Raspberry Pi via PyPi. This will
        install the library so you can use it with Python 3. We are also working
        on a one line installer that will install the library and expamples, but
        this is not ready yet. To install, fire up Terminal which you’ll find in
        Menu > Accessories > Terminal on your Raspberry Pi desktop, which is
        shown below:

        In the terminal window you have just opened, type the command below to
        install the library (if you get any errors, check for spelling
        mistakes):
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           sudo pip3 install pixel-zero
