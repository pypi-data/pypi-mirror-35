A zero boilerplate neopixel control library for the Raspberry Pi

Installing
==========

PixelZero can be downloaded to your Raspberry Pi via PyPi. This will
install the library so you can use it with Python 3. We are also working
on a one line installer that will install the library and expamples, but
this is not ready yet. To install, fire up Terminal which you’ll find in
Menu > Accessories > Terminal on your Raspberry Pi desktop, which is
shown below:

In the terminal window you have just opened, type the command below to
install the library (if you get any errors, check for spelling
mistakes):

.. code:: bash

   sudo pip3 install pixel-zero

Contributing:
=============

If you want to contribute, you should first clone this repository,
``cd`` to the library directory on your Raspberry Pi, and then run:

.. code:: bash

   sudo python3 setup.py install

Don’t forget to submit a pull request when contributing, this is the
best way for your code to get merged!
