Description: # EnTrance
        
        EnTrance is a framework for writing simple but robust web apps, using a 
        Python 3.5+ asyncio backend, and an Elm frontend.
        
        Communication between the frontend and backend is via JSON messages sent
        asynchronously over a websocket. Websocket connectivity is typically required
        for the frontend to function. The backend is fully generic, but happens to come
        with particularly rich built-in options for communicating with routers.
        
        This is an early commit, and is a bit sparse on documentation. 
        A design document is in the `docs` directory in the repo; this
        explains concepts and terminology required to fully understand the APIs
        for both Elm and Python.
        
        The single repo includes both the Python package (published in PyPi) and 
        the Elm package (published in elm-package).
