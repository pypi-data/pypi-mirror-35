        Vulcan Builder
        ==============
        
        This project is a fork of Pynt by `Raghunandan
        Rao <https://github.com/rags/pynt>`__. We will contribute changes to the
        original rags/pynt repo.
        
        Vulcan Builder supports EXR’s applications via a lightweight, concise
        Python DevOps tool. We will develop our own improvements on the initial
        rags/pynt repo here and publish improvements to the original repo.
        
        This is an EXR Open Source project.
        
        A pynt of Python build.
        =======================

        -  Additional tasks timing reporting
        -  Debug mode
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install vulcan-builder from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or
        from source.
        
        Using pip
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ pip install vulcan-builder
        
        Using easy_install
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ easy_install vulcan-builder
        
        Example
        -------
        
        The build script is written in pure Python and vulcan-builder takes care
        of managing any dependencies between tasks and generating a command line
        interface.
        
        Writing build tasks is really simple, all you need to know is the @task
        decorator. Tasks are just regular Python functions marked with the
        ``@task()`` decorator. Dependencies are specified with ``@task()`` too.
        Tasks can be ignored with the ``@task(ignore=True)``. Disabling a task
        is an useful feature to have in situations where you have one task that
        a lot of other tasks depend on and you want to quickly remove it from
        the dependency chains of all the dependent tasks.
        
        **build.py**
        ------------
        
        .. code:: python
        
        
           #!/usr/bin/python
        
           import sys
           from vulcan.builder import task
        
           @task()
           def clean():
               '''Clean build directory.'''
               print 'Cleaning build directory...'
        
           @task(clean)
           def html(target='.'):
               '''Generate HTML.'''
               print 'Generating HTML in directory "%s"' %  target
        
           @task(clean, ignore=True)
           def images():
               '''Prepare images.'''
               print 'Preparing images...'
        
           @task(html,images)
           def start_server(server='localhost', port = '80'):
               '''Start the server'''
               print 'Starting server at %s:%s' % (server, port)
        
           @task(start_server) #Depends on task with all optional params
           def stop_server():
               print 'Stopping server....'
        
           @task()
           def copy_file(src, dest):
               print 'Copying from %s to %s' % (src, dest)
        
           @task()
           def echo(*args,**kwargs):
               print args
               print kwargs
               
           # Default task (if specified) is run when no task is specified in the command line
           # make sure you define the variable __DEFAULT__ after the task is defined
           # A good convention is to define it at the end of the module
           # __DEFAULT__ is an optional member
        
           __DEFAULT__=start_server
        
        **Running vulcan-builder tasks**
        --------------------------------
        
        The command line interface and help is automatically generated. Task
        descriptions are extracted from function docstrings.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ vb -h
           usage: vb [-h] [-l] [-v] [-f file] [task [task ...]]
        
           positional arguments:
             task                  perform specified task and all its dependencies
        
           optional arguments:
             -h, --help            show this help message and exit
             -l, --list-tasks      List the tasks
             -v, --version         Display the version information
             -f file, --file file  Build file to read the tasks from. Default is
                                   'build.py'
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ vb -l
           Tasks in build file ./build.py:
             clean                       Clean build directory.
             copy_file                   
             echo                        
             html                        Generate HTML.
             images           [Ignored]  Prepare images.
             start_server     [Default]  Start the server

        vulcan-builder takes care of dependencies between tasks. In the
        following case start_server depends on clean, html and image generation
        (image task is ignored).
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ vb #Runs the default task start_server. It does exactly what "vb start_server" would do.
           [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
           Cleaning build directory...
           [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
           [ example.py - Starting task "html" ]
           Generating HTML in directory "."
           [ example.py - Completed task "html" ]
           [ example.py - Ignoring task "images" ]
           [ example.py - Starting task "start_server" ]
           Starting server at localhost:80
           [ example.py - Completed task "start_server" ]
        
        The first few characters of the task name is enough to execute the task,
        as long as the partial name is unambigious. You can specify multiple
        tasks to run in the commandline. Again the dependencies are taken taken
        care of.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ vb cle ht cl
           [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
           Cleaning build directory...
           [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
           [ example.py - Starting task "html" ]
           Generating HTML in directory "."
           [ example.py - Completed task "html" ]
           [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
           Cleaning build directory...
           [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
        
        The ‘html’ task dependency ‘clean’ is run only once. But clean can be
        explicitly run again later.
        
        vb tasks can accept parameters from commandline.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ vb "copy_file[/path/to/foo, path_to_bar]"
           [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
           Cleaning build directory...
           [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
           [ example.py - Starting task "copy_file" ]
           Copying from /path/to/foo to path_to_bar
           [ example.py - Completed task "copy_file" ]
        
        vb can also accept keyword arguments.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ vb start[port=8888]
           [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
           Cleaning build directory...
           [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
           [ example.py - Starting task "html" ]
           Generating HTML in directory "."
           [ example.py - Completed task "html" ]
           [ example.py - Ignoring task "images" ]
           [ example.py - Starting task "start_server" ]
           Starting server at localhost:8888
           [ example.py - Completed task "start_server" ]
               
           $ vb echo[hello,world,foo=bar,blah=123]
           [ example.py - Starting task "echo" ]
           ('hello', 'world')
           {'blah': '123', 'foo': 'bar'}
           [ example.py - Completed task "echo" ]
        
        **Organizing build scripts**
        ----------------------------
        
        You can break up your build files into modules and simple import them
        into your main build file.
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from deploy_tasks import *
           from test_tasks import functional_tests, report_coverage
