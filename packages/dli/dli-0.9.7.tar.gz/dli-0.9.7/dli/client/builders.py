class PackageBuilder:
    """
        Allows specifying the metadata a new package requires.

        Packages are parent structures that contain metadata relating
        to a collection of Datasets.

        This builder object sets sensible defaults and exposes
        helper methods on how to configure its storage options.

        See description for each parameter, and whether they are optional or mandatory.

        :param str name: Mandatory. A descriptive name of a package. It should be unique across the Data Catalogue.
        :param str description: Mandatory. A short description of a package.
        :param str data_source: Mandatory. Accepted values are: `Internal` or `External`.
                            Package is `External` if the underlying data is
                            created externally, e.g. S&P, Russell, etc.
                            Packages with data created at IHS Markit are `Internal`.
        :param str data_access: Mandatory. Accepted values are: `Restricted` or `Unrestricted`.
                            Defaults to `Restricted`.
                            If access to the package is flagged as `Restricted`,
                            package manager will have to grant or deny access to the underlying data.
                            If access is flagged as `Unrestricted`, user will be able to gain
                            access instantaneously after submitting the access request form.
        :param str visibility: Mandatory. Accepted values are: `Internal`, `Public`, `Private`.
                            Defaults to `Internal`.
                            Reserved for future use.
        :param str product: Optional. A group of packages. Packages usually sold or accessed together
                        can be associated using a Product. Future functionality will provide
                        ability to identify all packages associated with a specific product.
        :param str industry_or_sector: Optional. Industry/sector the data in the package is about.
                                   Not applicable, if the package content is not industry specific.
        :param str region: Optional. Region the data in the package is about.
                       If the package content is not geography specific this can be left blank.

                                representing company or IHS Markit business
                                unit that has created the data.
                                Defaults to your Data Lake Account if none provided.
        :param str publisher: Mandatory. Account ID for the Data Lake Account representing
                          IHS Markit business unit that is responsible for uploading

                         package through the search interface.
        :param str manager: Mandatory. Account ID for the Data Lake Account representing IHS Markit
                        business unit that is responsible for creating and
