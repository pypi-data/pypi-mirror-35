Description: Micral (MICROstructure anALysis)
        
        Harmonic measurement module
        
        -----
        
        Description :
        
        The aim is to figure out in what extend a given microstrucure could be considered like an harmonic structure or not.
        
        -----
        
        Installation :
        
        pip install micral_harmonic
        
        -----
        
        Usage :
        
        In a python file or directly in the interpreter, type :
        
        import micral_harmonic
        print(micral_harmonic.analyse(<your image>))
        
        Where <your image> is the name of the image to analyse (with extension (ie jpg, png, bmp etc...))
        The output is an unique value.
        
        It's also possible to send multiple image at once : in that case, provide a list of name :
        <your image> = [<image1>, <image2>, ...]
        And the return will be also a list of all the results
        
        Note that the image must be in the same directory than the python file (or in the current directory of the command)
