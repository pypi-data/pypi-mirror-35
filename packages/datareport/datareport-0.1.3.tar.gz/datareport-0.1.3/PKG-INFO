Description: 
        # Reporter
        
           This tool helps in gathering and formatting of data into a report. The tool
           `reporter.py` basically combines YAML data files with Jinja2-based
           templates.  In this way simple markup versions of your report can be
           produced. Together with a format converter like [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org)
           the produced output can then be converted to various target formats (HTML,
           PDF, ...).
        
           To keep a good overview which data is aquired for different parts of the
           report, it is probably a good step to automate the whole workflow with a
           tool like [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or other
           make-like tools.
        
        
        # Install
        
           The fastest way to install datareport is to use your systems tools:
        
            pip install datareport
        
           To use the latest test version check out the test.pypi server:
        
            pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple datareport
        
           Currently no executable is installed, but you can set an alias in your bash
           with
        
            alias reporter='python -c "from datareport import reporter; reporter.main()"'
        
           If you want to have this permanently configured, just paste this line into
           your `.bashrc` (or equivalent).
        
        ## Requirements
        
           All required packages are listed in `environment.yaml`. In case you
           installed datareport via a package management system like pip, anaconda,
           miniconda, ... all dependencies should already be installed automatically.
