deprecations:
    - Passing in the date as a string in the format "%b %d %Y" to the function
      get_test_counts_in_date_rage() in the DB API. Instead pass the date in
      as a datetime object.
fixes:
  - Setting the date as an ISO8601, as indicated by the docs and --help, for
    the subunit2sql-graph command agg_count will now work correctly. It would
    previously stack trace. (Story 2000581)
