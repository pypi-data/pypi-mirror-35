    subunit2sql is moving from using a UUID string as the primary key (aka the
    id column) on all tables to using an integer.
features:
  - Significant performance improvement especially on the test_runs table
    which can get very slow depending on the amount of data
upgrade:
  - This migration, 2822a408bdd0, is partially an offline upgrade. It is not
    safe to write new data to the database while it is running.
  - This migration is quite lengthy in operation it can take several days to
    run and consumes quite a bit of space, especially with very large
    databases.
critical:
  - The subunit2sql-graph commands which were previously using a tests.id
    column to identify a test are changed to use the tests_id column. This is
    because the switch from UUID to int will break the old mechanism anyway
    and doing this conversion will protect against future internal changes
