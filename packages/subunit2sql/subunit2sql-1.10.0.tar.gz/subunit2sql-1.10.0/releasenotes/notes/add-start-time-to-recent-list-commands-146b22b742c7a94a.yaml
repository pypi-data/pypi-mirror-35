  - An optional `start_date` parameter was added to all DB API functions that
    returned a recent runs list. This includes get_recent_successful_runs(),
    get_recent_failed_runs(), and get_recent_runs_by_key_value_metadata(). This
    is to set a starting point for the list of recent runs returned by these
    methods.
