features:
  - A new option is added to the subunit2sql CLI command,
    --non_subunit_name, that is used to allow subunit files with
    mixed content. The default is to raise an error containing the
    non-subunit byte after it has been read from the stream. By
    using this new option, the error will not be raised.
