features:
  - A new CLI / configuration option remove_test_attr_prefix
    is available to remove the test attribute prefix from test
    attributes before they are added to the test metadata.
    The CLI option defaults to False, so that the current
    behavior is preserved. It is only applicable when used in
    combination with test_attr_prefix.
upgrade:
  - The test attribute prefix is removed from the
    test attributes before they are injected into the DB,
    when using the remove_test_attr_prefix config/CLI option.
    If metadata was injected before, enabling
    remove_test_attr_prefix may lead to test metadata
    duplication, with and without prefix.
