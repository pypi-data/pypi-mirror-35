# DEPRECATED LIBRARY Adafruit Python TCS34725

This library has been deprecated!

We are now only using our CircuitPython sensor libraries in Python.

We are leaving the code up for historical/research purposes but archiving the
repository.

Check out this guide for using the TCS34725 with Python!

Python code to use the TCS34725 color sensor with the Raspberry Pi &amp; BeagleBone Black.

## Installation

To install the library from source (recommended) run the following commands on a Raspberry Pi or other Debian-based OS system:

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential python-dev
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_TCS34725.git
    cd Adafruit_Python_TCS34725
    sudo python setup.py install

Alternatively you can install from pip with:

    sudo pip install adafruit-tcs34725

Note that the pip install method **won't** install the example code.
