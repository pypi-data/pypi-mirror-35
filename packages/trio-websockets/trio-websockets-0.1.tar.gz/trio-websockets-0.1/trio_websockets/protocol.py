class WebSocketCommonProtocol:
    """
    This class implements common parts of the WebSocket protocol.

    It assumes that the WebSocket connection is established. The handshake is
    managed in subclasses such as
    :class:`~websockets.server.WebSocketServerProtocol` and
    :class:`~websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol`.

    On Python â‰¥ 3.6, :class:`WebSocketCommonProtocol` instances support
    asynchronous iteration::

        async for message in websocket:
            await process(message)

    The iterator yields incoming messages. It exits normally when the
    connection is closed with the status code 1000 (OK) or 1001 (going away).
    It raises a :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed` exception when
    the connection is closed with any other status code.

    The ``host``, ``port`` and ``secure`` parameters are simply stored as
    attributes for handlers that need them.

    The ``timeout`` parameter defines the maximum wait time in seconds for
    completing the closing handshake and, only on the client side, for
    terminating the TCP connection. :meth:`close()` will complete in at most
    ``4 * timeout`` on the server side and ``5 * timeout`` on the client side.

    The ``max_size`` parameter enforces the maximum size for incoming messages
    in bytes. The default value is 1MB. ``None`` disables the limit. If a
    message larger than the maximum size is received, :meth:`recv()` will
    raise :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed` and the connection
    will be closed with status code 1009.

    As soon as the HTTP request and response in the opening handshake are
    processed, the request path is available in the :attr:`path` attribute,
    and the request and response HTTP headers are available:

    * as a :class:`~http.client.HTTPMessage` in the :attr:`request_headers`
      and :attr:`response_headers` attributes
    * as an iterable of (name, value) pairs in the :attr:`raw_request_headers`
      and :attr:`raw_response_headers` attributes

    These attributes must be treated as immutable.

    If a subprotocol was negotiated, it's available in the :attr:`subprotocol`
    attribute.

    Once the connection is closed, the status code is available in the
    :attr:`close_code` attribute and the reason in :attr:`close_reason`.
