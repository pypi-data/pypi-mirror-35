"""
Extension of the built-in file module to support an arbitrary `exists` method
for knowing if a file, directory, device, symlink, etc exists or not. The
existing methods `file_exists` and `directory_exists` only look at those
types, so there's not a convenient way of checking if /dev/xvdj exists for
example.
