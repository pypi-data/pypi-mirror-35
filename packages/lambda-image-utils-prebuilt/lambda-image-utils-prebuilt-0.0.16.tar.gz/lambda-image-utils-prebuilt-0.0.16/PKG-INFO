Description: # lambda-image-utils-prebuilt
        A prebuilt set of the dependencies needed to run some common image utilities in AWS Lambda. This solves two main problems:
        
        1. Builds some dependencies that need to be built in the AWS Lambda runtime environment.
        2. Works arounds AWS Lambda's source code size limitation.
        
        ## Usage
        `pip install lambda-image-utils-prebuilt`
        
        Then, simply place this as the first import in your lambda function's handler:
        
        `import lambda-image-utils-prebuilt.unpack`
        
        ## How it Works
        The libs needed for face_recognition are built inside a Docker container that matches the environment in which AWS Lambda code is ran.
        
        Since the dependencies for face_recognition exceed the source code size limit of AWS Lambda functions, we do some ridiculousness to make it work. We zip up the deps and then unzip them at runtime.
        
        The dependencies in `prebuilt-requirements.txt` are generally large dependencies, therefore, these are included as well so that you can keep the source code size of your Lambda function small enough to deploy.
        
        The unzipping of these deps at runtime will add overhead to your function's start time. So, please keep that in mind in deciding whether to use this package.
        
        ## See it in Action
        [Here](https://github.com/JonathanPorta/lambda_face_recognition_example) is an example project that uses the [face_recognition portion](https://github.com/JonathanPorta/lambda_face_recognition_prebuilt) of this project as one of its dependencies.
