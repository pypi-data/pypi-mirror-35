- Secure container isolation for Storlets environment is still an ongoing
  work. Storlets enables user-defined code to run on the OpenStack Swift
  node with Docker container isolation level but a malicious user would run
  any attacking code there using recent vulnerability. Using more secure
  container like kata may mitigate such a risk of vulnerability.
