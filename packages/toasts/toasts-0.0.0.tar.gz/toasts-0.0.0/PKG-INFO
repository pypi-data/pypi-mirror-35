Description: 
        Toasts is an app that shows desktop notifications from various websites like GitHub,
        StackExchange, BitBucket, and the likes. It just runs in the background and shows
        you a notification when there is one from sites you have enabled. Authentication to
        your user account on a particular website is done through a Personal Access Token or
        Oauth.
        
        I'm still working on it, so hang tight :)
        
        For the first release, I'm planning to support GitHub only. StackExchange, BitBucket,
        Libraries.io, etc, will be supported on subsequent releases.
