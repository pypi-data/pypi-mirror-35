PyEPR provides Python_ bindings for the ENVISAT
Product Reader C API (`EPR API`_) for reading satellite data from ENVISAT_
ESA_ (European Space Agency) mission.

PyEPR, as well as the `EPR API`_ for C, supports ENVISAT_ MERIS, AATSR
Level 1B and Level 2 and also ASAR data products. It provides access to
the data either on a geophysical (decoded, ready-to-use pixel samples)
or on a raw data layer. The raw data access makes it possible to read
any data field contained in a product file.
