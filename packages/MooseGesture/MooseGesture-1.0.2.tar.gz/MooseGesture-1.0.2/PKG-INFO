        MooseGesture
        ============
        
        A mouse gesture recognition module for Python 2 and 3.
        
        This module is fed a series of XY coordinates (which can come from the mouse or another source) and can recognize when the mouse is moving in one of the eight cardinal/diagonal directions.
        
        These mouse movements can be combined to form "mouse gestures" to perform different commands.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
            ``pip install moosegesture``
        
        Quickstart Guide
        ================
        
        Pass a path as sequence of (x, y) tuples to `getGesture()`, which will return a list of directions that the path takes. These are the up, down, left, right, and diagonal directions represented by the following strings:
        
            ``'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'``
        
            ``'UL', 'UR', 'DL', 'DR'``
        
        They are stored in the following constants:
        
            ``UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT``
        
            ``UPLEFT, UPRIGHT, DOWNLEFT, DOWNRIGHT``
        
        Example usage:
        
            >>> import moosegesture
            >>> moosegesture.getGesture([(332, 385), (332, 287), (332, 175), (330, 69), (324, 13), (322, 0)])
            ['U']
        
        MooseGesture can also find the closest matching gesture in a list of gestures, using Levenshtein edit distance:
        
            >>> path  = ['D', 'L', 'R']
            >>> gestures = [['D', 'L', 'D'], ['D', 'R', 'UR']]
            >>> moosegesture.findClosestMatchingGesture(path, gestures)
            ['D', 'L', 'D']
        
        The same direction will never appear consecutively, i.e. there will never be a "right-left-left" gesture, only "right-left".
        
        Demo Programs
        =============
        
        The repo at https://github.com/asweigart/moosegesture contains a `tests/demoGestureApp.py` which uses Pygame to display a small window. You can draw gestures in this window by dragging the mouse, and the recognized gesture will appear at the bottom.
        
        The `simongesture.py` game is a Simon game that make uses of `moosegesture`. It requires Pygame to play.
