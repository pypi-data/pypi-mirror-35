Description: # DeliveryBoy
        
        DeliveryBoy is a lightweight and transparent intermediary for executing a Python
        callable in a new Python process such that a developer using this intermediary 
        does not have to care. 
        
        The new Python process is started by a transport command yield a wide range of 
        applications, e.g.:
        
        - Execution as a different user by `sudo`. 
        - Execution on a remote host by `ssh`.
        - Execution on a HPC cluster by `bsub` (in case of LSF).
        
        The base assumptions for this implementation are:
        
        - On the target host a compatible version of Python is installed.
        - On the target host the Python environment contains the deliveryboy package.
        - The Python environment on the source and target hosts are identical (aka. same modules installed).
        - Only the callable, module names for modules in the (virtual) environment and modules from outside the environment need to be transported.

        ## State of the project
        
        The simple demonstrator examples are working with Python 3, but not all features
        have been implemented and tested, yet.
        
        ## Contributing
        
        Please feel free to contribute by suggesting additional features, fixing bugs or
        implementing missing features.
