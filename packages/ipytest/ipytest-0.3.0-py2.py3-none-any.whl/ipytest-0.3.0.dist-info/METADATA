# ipytest - unit tests in IPython notbeooks

Sometimes quick experiments in IPython grow large and you find yourself wanting
unit tests. This module aims to make testing code in IPython notebooks easy. At
its core, it offers a test runner that execute all tests defined inside the
notebook environment. It is also designed to make the transfer of the tests into
proper python modules easy.

Installation: `pip install ipytest`


## Changes

- `0.3.0`: change default pattern for `clean_tests` to match pytest discovery
- `0.2.2`: add support for assert rewriting with current pytest versions
- `0.2.1`: add ipython magics to simplify test execution
- `0.2.0`: support for using pytest inside notebooks
- `0.1.0`: support for running `unittest.FunctionTestCase`,
  `unittest.TestCases`, and `doctests`.


## Features

- simple interface
- builds on standard unittest
- support for doctests
- support for pandas and numpy.
- support for [pytest](pytest.org) (with all bells and whistles)
- magics for easy execution


## Examples

- [unittest runner](./example/Example.ipynb)
- [pytest runner ](./example/Magics.ipynb)
- [pytest runner (no magics)](./example/PyTest.ipynb)

## Development

To execute the unit tests of `ipytest` run

    pipenv sync --dev
    pipenv run test

## Reference

### `%%run_pytest ...`

IPython magic that first executes the cell, then executes `run_pytest`.
Any arguments passed on the magic line be passed on to pytest.
To register the magics, run `import ipytest.magics` first.

For example:

```python
%%run_pytest -vvv


def test_example():
    ...

```

### `%%run_pytest[clean] ...`

Same as the `%%run_pytest`, but cleans any previously found tests, i.e., only
tests defined in the current cell are executed.

### `%%rewrite_asserts`

Rewrite any asserts in the current cell using pytest without running the tests.
To get best results run the tests with `run_pytest`.

For example::

```python
%%rewrite_asserts

def test_example():
    ...
```

### ipytest.run_pytest(module=None, filename=None, pytest_options=(), pytest_plugins=())

Execute tests in the passed module (defaults to __main__) with pytest.

**Arguments:**

- `module`: the module containing the tests.
  If not given, `__main__` will be used.
- `filename`: the filename of the file containing the tests.
  It has to be a real file, e.g., a notebook name, since its existence will
  be checked by pytest.
  If not given, the `__file__` attribute of the passed module will be used.
- `pytest_options`: additional options passed to pytest
- `pytest_plugins`: additional plugins passed to pytest

### ipytest.run_tests(doctest=False, items=None)

Run all tests in the given items dictionary.

**Arguments:**

- `doctest`: if True search for doctests.
- `items`: the globals object containing the tests. If `None` is given, the
    globals object is determined from the call stack.

### ipytest.clean_tests(pattern="test*", items=None)

Delete tests with names matching the given pattern.

In IPython the results of all evaluations are kept in global variables
unless explicitly deleted. This behavior implies that when tests are renamed
the previous definitions will still be found if not deleted. This method
aims to simply this process.

An effecitve pattern is to start with the cell containing tests with a call
to `clean_tests`, then defined all test cases, and finally call `run_tests`.
This way renaming tests works as expected.

**Arguments:**

- `pattern`: a glob pattern used to match the tests to delete.
- `items`: the globals object containing the tests. If `None` is given, the
    globals object is determined from the call stack.

### ipytest.collect_tests(doctest=False, items=None)

Collect all test cases and return a `unittest.TestSuite`.

The arguments are the same as for `ipytest.run_tests`.

### ipytest.assert_equals(a, b, *args, **kwargs)

Compare two objects and throw and exception if they are not equal.

This method uses `ipytest.get_assert_function` to determine the assert
implementation to use depending on the argument type.

**Arguments**

- `a`, `b`: the two objects to compare.
- `args`, `kwargs`: (keyword) arguments that are passed to the underlying
    test function. This option can, for example, be used to set the
    tolerance when comparing `numpy.array` objects

### ipytest.get_assert_function(a, b)

Determine the assert function to use depending on the arguments.

If either object is a `numpy .ndarray`, a `pandas.Series`, a
`pandas.DataFrame`, or `pandas.Panel`, it returns the assert functions
supplied by `numpy` and `pandas`.

### ipytest.unittest_assert_equals(a, b)

Compare two objects with the `assertEqual` method of `unittest.TestCase`.
