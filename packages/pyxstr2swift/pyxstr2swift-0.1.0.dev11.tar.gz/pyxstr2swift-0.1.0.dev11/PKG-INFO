Description: # pyxstr2swift
        Python package for a Xcode strings file to a swift localized string file
        
        For example,
        ```swift
        import Foundation
        
        struct Localized {
          static let edit = "edit".localized // edit
        }
        
        ```
        
        It is available in python2.7 and python3
        
        ```console
        foo@bar:~$ pip install -U pyxstr2swift
        ```
        
        ```console
        foo@bar:~$ xstr2swift [-f] [-m] [source_path] [target_path] [struct_name]
        foo@bar:~$ python -m pyxstr2swift.pyxstr2swift [-f] [-m] [source_path] [target_path] [struct_name]
        ```
        
        For using it, you should import a string extension library or write it.
        Below the library help you to use it easily.

        To use it in Xcode build pharses,
        1. Install this module using python PIP.
        If pip is not installed on your device, this command helps you. 
        
        ```console
        foo@bar:~$ brew install python
        foo@bar:~$ pip3 install -U pyxstr2swift
        ```
        
        2. Add a output swift file to your project
        3. Add a strings file to your project and write string keys and values
        4. Add Run Script to build pharses before Compile Sources
        5. Change Shell /bin/sh to /bin/bash (or /bin/zsh)
        6. Write shell command.
        For example,
        ```console
        xstr2swift -f -m "${SRCROOT}/Your project/en.lproj/Localized.strings" "${SRCROOT}/Your project/Localized.swift" "Localized"
        ```
        
        7. That' all! You run build now!
