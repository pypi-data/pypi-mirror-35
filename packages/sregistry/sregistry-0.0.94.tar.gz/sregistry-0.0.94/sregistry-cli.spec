# Singularity Global Client
Hi Friends! Are your containers lonely? Singularity containers thrive in happiness when they are shared. This means that wherever you might have them in these cloudy places, they are easy to find and move around.
## What is this?
Singularity Global Client is an interface to interact with Singularity containers in many different storage locations. We are able to use modern APIs by way of providing and using the software within a Singularity container!
See our [installation guide](https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli/install) to get started.
